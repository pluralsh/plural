        "text": "# XML Runbooks\n\nCreating a Plural runbook from XML.\n\n#### XML Tag Definitions\n\n[](/adding-new-application/getting-started-with-runbooks/runbook-xml#xml-tag-definitions)\n\nPlural runbooks are written in XML. XML doesn\u2019t have a predefined markup language, like HTML does. Instead, XML allows users to create their own markup symbols to describe content, making an unlimited and self-defining symbol set.\n\nWe have defined the following xml attributes in an Elixir file that may be used in the creation of your own runbooks and help standardize their layout.\n\n```\ndefmodule Console.Runbooks.Display do\n  use Console.Runbooks.Display.Base\n  alias Console.Runbooks.Display.{Xml}\n\n  schema do\n    component \"box\" do\n      attributes ~w(direction width height pad margin align justify gap fill color border borderSide borderSize)\n      parents ~w(root box)\n    end\n\n    component \"text\" do\n      attributes ~w(size weight value color)\n      parents ~w(box text root link)\n    end\n\n    component \"markdown\" do\n      attributes ~w(size weight value)\n      parents ~w(box text root)\n    end\n\n    component \"button\" do\n      attributes ~w(primary label href target action headline)\n      parents ~w(box)\n    end\n\n    component \"input\" do\n      attributes ~w(placeholder name label datatype)\n      parents ~w(box)\n    end\n\n    component \"timeseries\" do\n      attributes ~w(label datasource)\n      parents ~w(box)\n    end\n\n    component \"valueFrom\" do\n      attributes ~w(datasource path doc)\n      parents ~w(input text)\n    end\n\n    component \"image\" do\n      attributes ~w(width height url)\n      parents ~w(box link)\n    end\n\n    component \"video\" do\n      attributes ~w(width height url autoPlay loop)\n      parents ~w(box link)\n    end\n\n    component \"link\" do\n      attributes ~w(href target value color weight)\n      parents ~w(text box)\n    end\n\n    component \"table\" do\n      attributes ~w(name width height datasource path)\n      parents ~w(box)\n    end\n\n    component \"tableColumn\" do\n      attributes ~w(path header width)\n      parents ~w(table)\n    end\n  end\n\n  def parse_doc(xml) do\n    with {:ok, parsed} <- Xml.from_xml(xml) do\n      case validate(parsed) do\n        :pass -> {:ok, parsed}\n        {:fail, error} -> {:error, error}\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nMost of these attributes, like box and input are basically grommet React components. However, we would like to call out a few custom attributes that interact with other data from the runbook. They each refer to a datasource and then maybe also a way to access a value at that datasource.\n\ntimeseriesdatasourcevalueFromdatasourcedocpath\n\ndatasource\n\ndatasourcedocpath\n\nHere is an example Runbook XML template composed of these attributes.\n\n```\n<root gap='medium'>\n  <box pad='small' gap='medium' direction='row' align='center'>\n    <button label='Scale' action='scale' primary='true' headline='true' />\n    <box direction='row' align='center' gap='small'>\n      <box gap='small' align='center'>\n        <timeseries datasource=\"cpu\" label=\"CPU Usage\" />\n        <text size='small'>You should set a reservation to\n          roughly correspond to 30% utilization</text>\n      </box>\n      <box gap='small' align='center'>\n        <timeseries datasource=\"memory\" label=\"Memory Usage\" />\n        <text size='small'>You should set a reservation to\n          roughly correspond to 60% utilization</text>\n      </box>\n    </box>\n    <box gap='small'>\n      <box gap='xsmall'>\n        <input placeholder=\"250m\" label='CPU Request' name='cpu'>\n          <valueFrom\n            datasource=\"statefulset\"\n            doc=\"kubernetes.raw\"\n            path=\"spec.template.spec.containers[0].resources.requests.cpu\" />\n        </input>\n        <input placeholder=\"1Gi\" label='Memory Request' name='memory'>\n          <valueFrom\n            datasource=\"statefulset\"\n            doc=\"kubernetes.raw\"\n            path=\"spec.template.spec.containers[0].resources.requests.memory\" />\n        </input>\n      </box>\n    </box>\n  </box>\n  <box pad='small' gap='medium' direction='row' align='center'>\n    <box direction='row' width='70%' align='center'>\n      <text size='small'>You can also add more replicas to provide failover in case of outages, or optionally remove them to save cost</text>\n    </box>\n    <box direction='row' gap='small' width='30%' align='center'>\n      <input datatype='int' placeholder=\"1\" label='Replicas' name='replicas'>\n        <valueFrom\n          datasource=\"statefulset\"\n          doc=\"kubernetes.raw\"\n          path=\"spec.replicas\" />\n      </input>\n    </box>\n  </box>\n  <box width='100%' gap='small'>\n    <text size='small'>Be sure to scale your rabbitmq nodes within your nodes capacities, listed here:</text>\n    <table width='100%' datasource='nodes' path='nodes'>\n      <tableColumn path='metadata.name' header='name' width='33%' />\n      <tableColumn path='status.capacity.cpu' header='cpu' width='33%' />\n      <tableColumn path='status.capacity.memory' header='memory' width='33%' />\n    </table>\n  </box>\n</root>\n```\n\nThis XML file is referred to in the runbooks.yaml file, where you will also pass along the datasources that will hydrate this template.\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/adding-new-application/getting-started-with-runbooks/runbook-xml.md)",

At the moment, the only types Plural supports are prometheus, kubernetes, and nodes. Each type has a spec that's specific to the type.\n\nprometheus spec:\n\n```\nprometheus:\n  format:\n  legend:\n  query:\n```\n\nkubernetes spec:\n\n```\nkubernetes:\n  resource: # the kind of Kubernetes resource, i.e. statefulset\n  name: # the name of the Kubernetes resource, i.e. ghost\n```\n\nnodes spec:\n\n```\n# No spec needed, this just fetches all the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster.\n```\n\nAdditionally, in runbooks.yaml, you can define a specific action that the runbook can take based off of context from what the user input has given it.\n\nFor example, in the file above, we've defined an action that allows the runbook to update the home values file for that installation. It's done by yaml path, which means it will recursively update ghost.resources.request.cpu.\n\n[home values file](https://github.com/pluralsh/plural-artifacts/blob/760ad90c55d42a8f3081d6e5082c8a8e508ef1b4/ghost/helm/ghost/values.yaml)\n\nThis will update the yaml file, save it back, issue a commit, and create a build in the console to actually apply the change.\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/adding-new-application/getting-started-with-runbooks/runbook-yaml.md)",

Add your Helm chart\n\n[](/adding-new-application/guide#_2-add-your-helm-chart)\n\nThis section assumes familiarity with helm, the Kubernetes package manager. If you have not worked with helm before, it's strongly recommended that you read through the helm docs to understand core helm concepts, particularly helm templates and helm template values.\n\n[helm templates](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/getting_started/)\n\n### Getting Started with Helm\n\n[](/adding-new-application/guide#getting-started-with-helm)\n\nFrom the root of your newly created hasura directory, navigate to the helm chart.\n\n```\ncd helm/hasura\n```\n\nA helm chart is organized as a collection of files inside of a directory:\n\n```\nhasura/\n  Chart.yaml          # A YAML file containing information about the chart\n  values.yaml         # The default configuration values for this chart\n  values.schema.json  # OPTIONAL: A JSON Schema for imposing a structure on the values.yaml file\n  charts/             # A directory containing any charts upon which this chart depends.\n  templates/          # A directory of templates that, when combined with values,\n                      # will generate valid Kubernetes manifest files.\n```\n\nThe Chart.yaml file contains a description of the chart. You can access it from within a template.\n\nThe templates directory is for template files. When Helm evaluates a chart, it will send all of the files in the templates directory through the template rendering engine. It then collects the results of those templates and sends them on to Kubernetes.\n\nThe values.yaml file is also important to templates. This file contains the default values for a chart. These values may be overridden by users during helm install or helm upgrade.\n\nYou should also see a deps.yaml file. This is a Plural file used to track dependencies and sequence order of installations and upgrades.\n\n### Fill out Chart.yaml\n\n[](/adding-new-application/guide#fill-out-chart-yaml)\n\nOpen up the Chart.yaml file.\n\nChart.yaml is a yaml file containing information about the chart. You can refer to the helm documentation for a comprehensive list of fields in the chart.\n\n[a comprehensive list of fields](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#the-chartyaml-file)\n\nThe yaml is largely self-documenting. The field to pay attention to is the field at the end, dependencies. If your open source project has an existing helm chart (for example on ArtifactHub), this is where you'll want to link it.\n\n```\ndependencies:\n  - name: hasura\n    version: 1.1.6\n    repository: https://charts.platy.plus\n```\n\n### Fill out the templates directory\n\n[](/adding-new-application/guide#fill-out-the-templates-directory)\n\nNext, let's fill out the templates directory. Recall that the templates directory is for template files. When Helm evaluates a chart, it will send all of the files in the templates directory through the template rendering engine. It then collects the results of those templates and sends them on to Kubernetes.\n\nThe Plural platform includes a number of custom resources that you might find useful to fully productionize your application and can copy and paste over for your own use:\n\ndashboard.yaml -- creates dashboards in the console that reference Prometheus metricsrunbook.yaml -- creates interactive tutorials in the console that show how to perform common maintenance tasks. For more documentation on runbooks refer here.proxies.yaml -- wrappers around kubectl port-forward and kubectl proxy which allow you to get shells into running pods, databases or access private web uisconfigurationOverlay.yaml -- creates form fields to modify helm configuration within the console\n\n[dashboard.yaml](/adding-new-application/plural-custom-resources#dashboards.yaml)\n\n[runbook.yaml](/adding-new-application/getting-started-with-runbooks/runbook-yaml)\n\n[here](/adding-new-application/getting-started-with-runbooks)\n\n[proxies.yaml](/adding-new-application/plural-custom-resources#proxies-yaml)\n\n[configurationOverlay.yaml](/adding-new-application/plural-custom-resources#configurationoverlay-yaml)\n\n![Image](/assets/image%20(2).png)\n\nlogfilter.yaml\n\n### Fill out deps.yaml\n\n[](/adding-new-application/guide#fill-out-deps-yaml)\n\nThe deps.yaml file is a Plural file that is used for determining the sequence of installations and updates. It should look something like this:\n\n```\napiVersion: plural.sh/v1alpha1\nkind: Dependencies\nmetadata:\n  application: true\n  description: Deploys hasura crafted for the target cloud\nspec:\n  dependencies:\n    - type: helm\n      name: bootstrap\n      repo: bootstrap\n      version: '>= 0.5.1'\n    - type: helm\n      name: ingress-nginx\n      repo: ingress-nginx\n      version: '>= 0.1.2'\n    - type: helm\n      name: postgres\n      repo: postgres\n      version: '>= 0.1.6'\n    - type: terraform\n      name: aws\n      repo: hasura\n      version: '>= 0.1.0'\n      optional: true\n    - type: terraform\n      name: azure\n      repo: hasura\n      version: '>= 0.1.0'\n      optional: true\n    - type: terraform\n      name: gcp\n      repo: hasura\n      version: '>= 0.1.0'\n      optional: true\n```\n\n## 3. Add your cloud config\n\n[](/adding-new-application/guide#_3-add-your-cloud-config)\n\nFrom the root of the hasura/ directory (not the one on helm/ directory but its parent directory), navigate to the terraform/ directory. Terraform is a tool for creating, updating, and destroying cloud infrastructure via configuration rather than a graphical user interface. If you are not familiar with it, we suggest reading through the Terraform docs. The files that are located inside this directory are responsible for creating various cloud objects -- i.e. Kubernetes namespaces, AWS IAM roles, and service accounts.\n\n[Terraform docs](https://www.terraform.io/language)\n\n```\ncd terraform\n```\n\nYou should see three folders:\n\n```\nterraform\n  aws\n  azure\n  gcp\n```\n\nThey each have the same structure:\n\n```\nterraform/aws\n  deps.yaml\n  main.tf\n  terraform.tfvars\n  variables.tf\n```\n\nmain.tf will contain the main set of configuration for your Terraform module. You can also create other configuration files and organize them however it makes sense for your project. It will look something like this:\n\n[main.tf](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/module-create?in=terraform/modules#main-tf)\n\n```\nresource \"kubernetes_namespace\" \"hasura\" {\n  metadata {\n    name = var.namespace\n    labels = {\n      \"app.kubernetes.io/managed-by\" = \"plural\"\n      \"app.plural.sh/name\" = \"hasura\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\ndata \"aws_iam_role\" \"postgres\" {\n  name = \"${var.cluster_name}-postgres\"\n}\n\nresource \"kubernetes_service_account\" \"postgres\" {\n  metadata {\n    name      = \"postgres-pod\"\n    namespace = var.namespace\n\n    annotations = {\n      \"eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn\" = data.aws_iam_role.postgres.arn\n    }\n  }\n\n  depends_on = [\n    kubernetes_namespace.superset\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nvariables.tf will contain the variable definitions for your terraform module (the variables are used in main.tf\n\n[variables.tf](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/module-create?in=terraform/modules#variables-tf)\n\n## 4. Add your Plural config\n\n[](/adding-new-application/guide#_4-add-your-plural-config)\n\nFinally, let's look at how to set up the config that will go to Plural.\n\nFrom the root of hasura/, navigate to plural/recipes.\n\n```\nplural/recipes\n  hasura-aws.yaml\n  hasura-azure.yaml\n  hasura-gcp.yaml\n```\n\nHere, you will specify the other Plural packages that must be installed alongside this package, as well as configuration and documentation for parameters that you will be asking users to input.\n\n```\nname: hasura-aws\ndescription: Installs hasura on an EKS cluster\nprovider: AWS\ndependencies: # Other Plural packages that must be installed alongside this bundle\n  - repo: bootstrap\n    name: aws-k8s\n  - repo: ingress-nginx\n    name: ingress-nginx-aws\n  - repo: postgres\n    name: aws-postgres\nsections:\n  - name: hasura\n    items:\n      - type: TERRAFORM\n        name: aws\n      - type: HELM\n        name: hasura\n    configuration: # Users will be asked to input values for these parameters\n      - name: hostname\n        documentation: Fully Qualified Domain Name to use for your hasura installation, eg hasura.topleveldomain.com if topleveldomain.com is the domain you inputed for dns_domain above.\n        type: DOMAIN\n```\n\n## 5. Testing Locally\n\n[](/adding-new-application/guide#_5-testing-locally)\n\nYou can validate your changes locally using the plural link command. You'll need to have your packages pushed to plural first, then installed in an installation repo. Once done, you can link your local version of a helm or terraform package using:\n\n```\nplural link helm <app-name> --path ../path/to/helm --name <chart-name>\n```\n\n## 6. Push your local changes and open a PR\n\n[](/adding-new-application/guide#_6-push-your-local-changes-and-open-a-pr)\n\nAssuming that you have been working on a branch add-hasura you should now commit your changes and open up a PR on Github against the pluralsh/plural-artifacts repository.\n\n[pluralsh/plural-artifacts](https://github.com/pluralsh/plural-artifacts/)\n\n```\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Integrate hasura changes\"\ngit push\n```\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/adding-new-application/guide.md)",

This guide outlines the process.\n\n## Articles in this section:\n\nGuidePlural Custom ResourcesModule Library\n\n[Guide](/adding-new-application/guide)\n\n[Plural Custom Resources](/adding-new-application/plural-custom-resources)\n\n[Module Library](/adding-new-application/module-library)\n\nThe two main functionalities that make Plural work are dependency tracking between DevOps tools (Helm and Terraform) and templating.\n\nWhen a user sets up a new Plural workspace in a git repository a workspace.yaml file is created that stores global values for that cluster such as the cloud account and region, the cluster and VPC name and what subdomain all the applications will be hosted under. Next, the user can install an application using the plural bundle <app_name> <bundle> CLI command. The CLI will then prompt the user for for inputs needed to setup that application, along with any dependencies of the application. These inputs are saved in the context.yaml file.\n\nNext, the user runs plural build which will create a wrapper Helm chart and Terraform module. The wrapper Helm chart and Terraform module depend on the application Helm chart(s) and Terraform module(s) it gets from the Plural API, which the CLI downloads. The CLI will then generate the values.yaml for the wrapper helm chart and main.tf for the wrapper Terraform module using the values saved in the context.yaml using its templating engine.\n\n## Plural application artifacts\n\n[](/adding-new-application#plural-application-artifacts)\n\nAs mentioned above, the Plural CLI creates a wrapper Helm chart and Terraform module for each installed application and inputs the user defined values for that installation. Some extra files are necessary in Helm charts and Terraform modules for Plural to be able to understand their dependencies and run them through its templating engine. Namely, a deps.yaml file which lists the dependencies of the Helm chart or Terraform module, and the values.yaml.tpl and terraform.tfvars file for Helm and Terraform respectively.\n\nThe values.yaml.tpl and terraform.tfvars files are run through the Plural templating engine, which is similar to that of Helm, and are used to generate the values.yaml for the wrapper helm chart and main.tf for the wrapper Terraform module.\n\nThe next example is a snippet of the values.yaml.tpl file for Grafana:\n\n```\ngrafana:\n  admin:\n    password:\n      { { dedupe . \"grafana.grafana.admin.password\" (randAlphaNum 14) } }\n    user: admin\n  ingress:\n    tls:\n      - hosts:\n          - { { .Values.hostname } }\n        secretName: grafana-tls\n    hosts:\n      - { { .Values.hostname } }\n```\n\nIn the above example, the hostname a for Grafana that is saved in the context.yaml will be set in the ingress for Grafana by {{ .Values.hostname }}. It also showcases dedupe, which is one of the templating functions available in the Plural CLI.\n\nWe are using the dedupe function so that a new random password for the Grafana admin is not generated if it has already been set. The reason grafana.grafana.admin.password is specified for the path, is because the CLI will create a wrapper Helm chart named grafana in a user's installation workspace. Please see this section of the Helm docs for an explanation on how to pass values to a subchart.\n\n[this section](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/subcharts_and_globals/#overriding-values-from-a-parent-chart)\n\nThe next snippet shows a part of the terraform.tfvars for the AWS bootstrap terraform module:\n\n```\nvpc_name = {{ .Values.vpc_name | quote }}\ncluster_name = {{ .Cluster | quote }}\n```\n\nExcept for the user's application inputs from the context.yaml and the aforementioned dedupe function, Plural includes a lot of other values and functions that make it possible to simplify otherwise complex application configurations.\n\n### Templating reference\n\n[](/adding-new-application#templating-reference)\n\nAlong with the standard functions available in the Go templating language, the following Plural specific functions can be used.\n\n##### Functions:\n\n[](/adding-new-application#functions)\n\n##### Template values:\n\n[](/adding-new-application#template-values)\n\n##### .Config values:\n\n[](/adding-new-application#config-values)\n\n##### .OIDC values:\n\n[](/adding-new-application#oidc-values)\n\n##### .OIDC.Bindings values:\n\n[](/adding-new-application#oidc-bindings-values)\n\n##### .SMTP values:\n\n[](/adding-new-application#smtp-values)\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/adding-new-application/index.md)",

        "text": "# Architecture\n\nThe Plural architecture has three main components:\n\nPlural API and Catalog site (available at https://app.plural.sh)Plural CLI and Git SCM to maintain the state of a user's applicationsPlural console for management of all plural applications on your infrastructure\n\n[https://app.plural.sh](https://app.plural.sh)\n\nAt a high level, the interactions between all three components look something like this:\n\n![Image](/assets/reference/architecture.png)\n\n## Plural API\n\n[](/archive/architecture#plural-api)\n\nThe primary responsibility of the Plural API is to store the packages needed for application installation - terraform, helm - and ingesting high-level dependency information about them. This allows us to properly sequence installations. It also serves as a publish-subscribe layer to communicate updates to clusters that have installed those applications, and can leverage the dependency information ingested to delay updates until a cluster has caught up with all the necessary dependencies.\n\nIt also can serve as an identity provider for any Plural application, delegating authentication via OIDC and also maintaining user group info and communicating it down to applications.\n\nFinally it handles billing and licensing, supporting all the common constructs seen in modern SaaS billing\n\n## Plural CLI\n\n[](/archive/architecture#plural-cli)\n\nThe Plural CLI effectively uses the Plural API as a package manager, and works as a higher level build tool on top of the DevOps packages it supports. It will handle things like running installations in dependency order, detecting changes between runs, and templating out a workspace from scratch.\n\nIt also is responsible for managing secret encryption of all application state in plural installation repos and provides a few useful tools for troubleshooting an application our admin console might not be well-suited to solve.\n\nFinally it also provides the toolchain for publishing applications to the plural API.\n\n## Plural Console\n\n[](/archive/architecture#plural-console)\n\nThe Plural Console is the operational hub for all applications managed by Plural. It is deployed in-cluster alongside applications and provides a few key features:\n\nAutomated upgrades - by subscribing to the API's upgrade websocketObservability - leveraging the dashboard and logging Kubernetes CRDs deployed alongside Plural applicationsSupport - in-person support can be handled in our chat interface available directly in the admin console, with a lot of nice features like direct zoom integration\n\nIt's deployed as a highly available, scalable web service, with postgres as its datastore. It also directly integrates with Plural's OIDC for login and user management.\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/archive/architecture.md)",

Currently we require these details (although we'll support other git operating modes in the future):\n\nthe remote url should be ssh not httpsyou have a passphraseless ssh key with access to that repo you can offer to the consolethe ssh key should have write perms to the repo\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/archive/basics/AdminConsole.md)",

        "text": "# Getting Started using Plural\n\nBefore getting started with plural, you'll need to install a few dependencies:\n\nhelmterraformcloud provider cli (awscli, gcloud, az)\n\nIn addition, we require a few helm plugins to add additional features (like authenticated chartmuseum and diffing):\n\n```\nhelm plugin install https://github.com/chartmuseum/helm-push\nhelm plugin install https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff\n```\n\nFinally, you'll want to install the plural cli. This can actually be found using plural's artifact registry here:\n\n```\ncurl -L https://app.plural.sh/artifacts/plural/plural?platform=${plat}&arch=${arch} > /on/your/path/plural\nchmod +x /on/your/path/plural\n```\n\nCurrent values of (plat, arch) are:\n\nYou can see them listed here: https://app.plural.sh/repositories/b4ea03b9-d51f-4934-b030-ff864b720df6/artifacts along with download links\n\n## DNS\n\n[](/archive/basics/GettingStarted#dns)\n\nPlural uses externaldns for dns management in k8s. Programmatic registration of domains is not a solved problem at the moment, so we assume you've already set one up and have it available. It is best practice to consolidate your plural resources into a single subdomain to ensure we don't trample existing entries, but it should be safe if you don't as well.\n\n[externaldns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns)\n\nThe dns providers we currently support are:\n\nRoute53Google Cloud DNSAzure DNS\n\nIn all cases externaldns is configured to use pod assigned, temporary credentials.\n\n## Git setup\n\n[](/archive/basics/GettingStarted#git-setup)\n\nThe state of your installation is stored in a fresh git repo. Currently we're limited to a one cluster to one repo mapping, but eventually that will be relaxed. Additionally, the best supported method of authenticating to git using plural is via passphraseless ssh keys. Both GitLab and GitHub support this mode of operation, and you can always choose to use https://gitlab.plural.sh if your organization has no existing git-based SCM.\n\nOnce your repo has been cloned, run:\n\n```\nplural init\n```\n\nto log into plural, set the git attributes to configure encryption, and configure your cloud provider for this installation.\n\n## Installation\n\n[](/archive/basics/GettingStarted#installation)\n\nTo install applications on plural, the preferred method is to use our installation bundles, which provide a wizard-like installation process across an apps entire dependency tree. You can view the available bundles by navigating to the app on https://app.plural.sh or listing them via the cli using:\n\n```\nplural bundle list <app-name>\n```\n\nIf the app is paid, you should click on the bundle in the interface to ensure you set up all the subscriptions needed to install the application properly.\n\nOnce you've found the bundle you want and are ready to go, run this in the root of your repo:\n\n```\nplural bundle install <app-name> <bundle-name>\n```\n\nYou should be asked a lot of questions about how your app will be configured, which will ultimately spool your configuration to a file called context.yaml at the root of your repo.\n\n## Deployment\n\n[](/archive/basics/GettingStarted#deployment)\n\nWith all bundles installed, simply run:\n\n```\nplural build\nplural deploy\n```\n\nThis will generate all deployment artifacts in the repo, then deploy them in dependency order.\n\nOnce you're finished, commit your changes and push them upstream. This will be needed in case you use our admin console, which also uses git for state management:\n\n```\ngit add . && git commit -m \"Initial plural setup\"\ngit push\n```\n\n## Log In\n\n[](/archive/basics/GettingStarted#log-in)\n\nOnce plural deploy has completed, you should be ready to log in. The login credentials are usually available in the values.yaml for the applciation's helm chart. The key name should be pretty self-descriptive, for instance the initial admin password for the plural console is in a key named: secrets.adminPassword.\n\n## Upgrading and deploying new apps to an existing cluster\n\n[](/archive/basics/GettingStarted#upgrading-and-deploying-new-apps-to-an-existing-cluster)\n\nThe full plural build && plural deploy commands are only necessary if you have a queue of multiple apps to be deployed that you need assistance with sequencing the installations. If there's just a single targeted application to deploy, simply do:\n\n```\nplural build --only ${app}\nplural deploy\ngit add . && git commit -m \"updated ${app}\" # don't forget to commit and push your changes!\ngit push\n```\n\nFor the most part, plural console will do all of this for you if you chose to install it.\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/archive/basics/GettingStarted.md)",

        "text": "# Sharing Existing Plural Installation Repos\n\nLet's say that you have an existing Plural installation repo and you would like to share it with other users. A common scenario might be an individual developer playing around with Plural who would then like to expand Plural adoption across their team or company. Below, we show how to do this.\n\nLet's say that Alice is the original user and already has a few applications installed in their own Plural installation repo. Alice would now like to share the repo with Bob and Cory, their teammates on the machine learning infrastructure team.\n\n### 1. Bob and Cory Create Plural Accounts at plural.sh\n\n[plural.sh](https://app.plural.sh)\n\n[](/archive/sharing-existing-repos#_1-bob-and-cory-create-plural-accounts-at-plural-sh)\n\n### 2. Bob and Cory Install Plural CLI\n\n[](/archive/sharing-existing-repos#_2-bob-and-cory-install-plural-cli)\n\nThe Plural CLI and dependencies are available using a package manager for your system. For Mac, we recommend using Homebrew, although our Docker image should be usable on virtually any platform.\n\n```\nbrew install pluralsh/plural/plural\n```\n\nThe brew tap will install plural, alongside terraform, helm and kubectl for you. If you've already installed any of those dependencies, you can add --without-helm, --without-terraform, or --without-kubectl\n\nYou can also download any of our vendored binaries via curl:\n\n```\ncurl -L -o plural.o 'https://app.plural.sh/artifacts/plural/plural?platform={{plat}}&arch={{arch}}'\nchmod +x plural.o\nmv plural.o /usr/local/bin/plural\n```\n\nreplace plat and arch with any of:\n\nAll binaries can also be viewed in the artifacts tab of the plural repo on app.plural.sh. You can also find sha256 checksums for each there to guarantee file integrity\n\n[artifacts tab](https://app.plural.sh/repositories/b4ea03b9-d51f-4934-b030-ff864b720df6/artifacts)\n\nYou will still need to ensure helm, terraform and kubectl are properly installed, you can find installers for each here.\n\n[https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)\n\n[https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)\n\n[https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)\n\nOnce these are installed, you'll also need to add the helm push plugin like so:\n\n```\nhelm plugin install https://github.com/pluralsh/helm-push\n```\n\nWe offer a docker image with the plural cli installed along with all cli dependencies: Terraform, Helm, kubectl, and all the major cloud CLIs: gcr.io/pluralsh/plural-cli:0.1.1-cloud. We also provide a decent configuration of zsh in it, so you can drive the entire plural workflow in an interactive session. The best strategy is probably to mount the config dir of the cloud provider you're using, like \\~/.aws, in the docker run command:\n\n```\ndocker run -it --volume $HOME/.aws:/root/aws \\\n               --volume $HOME/.plural:/root/.plural \\\n               --volume $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh \\\n    gcr.io/pluralsh/plural-cli:0.1.1-cloud zsh\n```\n\nWe have EC2 AMI's with Plural CLI installed, along with all cloud provider CLIs, Terraform, Helm and kubectl for those interested in creating a remote environment. A registry of the AMIs can be viewed here:\n\n[here](https://github.com/pluralsh/plural-cli/blob/master/packer/manifest.json)\n\nIf there's interest in images for GCP and Azure, please to give us a shout in our discord or feel free to open a GitHub issue.\n\nThis doc gives more details on launching AMIs if you are unfamiliar. You'll want to select \"Public images\" within the AMI search bar and you can use the AMI id embedded in the artifact_id in our manifests, eg ami-0249247d5fc865089. Be sure to choose the one for the appropriate region.\n\n[This doc](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/launch-instance-custom-ami/)\n\nThe brew tap will install Plural, alongside Terraform, Helm and kubectl for you. If you've already installed any of those dependencies, you can add --without-helm, --without-terraform, or --without-kubectl\n\n### 3. Alice creates a Plural service account\n\n[Plural service account](/operations/auth-access-control/identity-and-installations/service-accounts)\n\n[](/archive/sharing-existing-repos#_3-alice-creates-a-plural-service-account)\n\nAlice follows the instructions here to create a Plural service account under the ml-infra@plural.sh email.\n\n[here](/operations/auth-access-control/identity-and-installations/service-accounts)\n\n### 4. Alice copies down which bundles they have installed for later reference\n\n[](/archive/sharing-existing-repos#_4-alice-copies-down-which-bundles-they-have-installed-for-later-reference)\n\nAlice can find which bundles they have installed at https://app.plural.sh/explore/installed\n\n[https://app.plural.sh/explore/installed](https://app.plural.sh/explore/installed)\n\n![Image](/assets/advanced-topics/installed-bundles.png)\n\n### 5. Alice changes the owner of the Plural installation repo\n\n[](/archive/sharing-existing-repos#_5-alice-changes-the-owner-of-the-plural-installation-repo)\n\nAlice goes to workspace.yaml in the root of their installation repo, and changes the owner to ml-infra@plural.sh. In the example below, owner is set to nick@plural.sh on line 12.\n\n![Image](/assets/advanced-topics/code-block.png)\n\n### 6. Alice initializes Plural as service account\n\n[](/archive/sharing-existing-repos#_6-alice-initializes-plural-as-service-account)\n\nAlice runs the following command from inside their Plural installation repo:\n\n```\nplural init --service-account ml-infra@plural.sh\n```\n\nThis switches to the ml-infra service account user.\n\n### 7. Alice registers all the bundles as the service account user\n\n[](/archive/sharing-existing-repos#_7-alice-registers-all-the-bundles-as-the-service-account-user)\n\nNow that Alice is using a different user, they need to re-register each installed application with the Plural API under the service account user. For each application, Alice should run:\n\n```\nplural bundle install <repo> <bundle>\n```\n\nTo recall which applications they have installed, Alice should refer to the information they copied in step 4.\n\n###### Info:\n\nService accounts need to be explicitly granted install permissions in your account before you can successfully run the bundle install command. Be sure to create a role here with install permissions and add the service account to it to grant them access.\n\n[here](https://app.plural.sh/account/roles)\n\n### 8. Alice builds and deploys the Plural installation repo under the new user\n\n[](/archive/sharing-existing-repos#_8-alice-builds-and-deploys-the-plural-installation-repo-under-the-new-user)\n\nAlice should run:\n\n```\nplural build\nplural deploy\n```\n\nFinally, Alice can push up these changes up to the installation repo on Github\n\n```\ngit commit -m \"Change owner of repo\"\ngit push\n```\n\n###### Info:\n\nIf a user has oidc configured for an app, occasionally you'll need to manually delete the pods associated with their webservers as our oidc proxy does not respect config changes. This is just a matter of finding the relevant pods in the console and clicking the trash icon. For airbyte as an example, you'd want to delete all the pods in deployment/airbyte-webapp.\n\nIf you'd like help with this process feel free to reach out to us on discord as well!\n\n### 9. Alice, Bob, and Cory set up cryptographic keys for sharing\n\n[](/archive/sharing-existing-repos#_9-alice-bob-and-cory-set-up-cryptographic-keys-for-sharing)\n\nThe next step is sharing the repository's cryptography layer with any users you expect to need to use the repo locally. If you want to learn more about how Plural encrypts your repository's state, we'd definitely recommend you read our docs here\n\n[here](/operations/security/secret-management)\n\nAlice, Bob, and Cory should each run:\n\n```\nplural crypto setup-keys --name <key-name>\n```\n\nThis causes each user to register a public key with Plural for sharing.\n\n### 10. Alice encrypts encryption key for every user's keypair\n\n[](/archive/sharing-existing-repos#_10-alice-encrypts-encryption-key-for-every-user-s-keypair)\n\nAlice should now run:\n\n```\nplural crypto share --email bob@plural.sh cory@plural.sh\n```\n\nThis will share the encryption key Alice has with Bob and Cory.\n\n### 11. Bob and Cory download Plural installation repo from Github\n\n[](/archive/sharing-existing-repos#_11-bob-and-cory-download-plural-installation-repo-from-github)\n\nBob and Cory should now go to Github and download the Plural installation repos.\n\n```\ngit clone <plural-installation-repo>\n```\n\n### 12. Bob and Cory initialize Plural in their own workspaces as service account\n\n[](/archive/sharing-existing-repos#_12-bob-and-cory-initialize-plural-in-their-own-workspaces-as-service-account)\n\nBob and Cory should initialize Plural as the service account\n\n```\nplural init --service-account ml-infra@plural.sh\n```\n\n### 13. Profit!\n\n[](/archive/sharing-existing-repos#_13-profit)\n\nFrom this point on, any of Alice, Bob, or Cory can install, build, and deploy new applications and have it be reflected under the ml-infra@plural.sh service account. They should always remember to push up their changes in Git, and to pull down any new changes that their teammates may have made prior to making new installations.\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/archive/sharing-existing-repos.md)",

        "title": " Installing Plural Console",
        "text": "# Installing Plural Console\n\nSupercharge your day two operations.\n\n## Introduction\n\n[](/getting-started/admin-console#introduction)\n\nThe Plural Admin Console is a web application that serves as a control panel for all your Plural applications. It:\n\nmanages automated upgrades delivered from the Kubernetes apiserves as a thin Grafana to visualize application metrics and logsserves as a built-in K8s dashboard for all plural apps in the cluster, along with providing app-level health checkingis the touchpoint at which incidents can be filed with the owner of an application\n\nPlural Console is installed by default in the Cloud Shell, and we also highly recommend installing it if using the Plural CLI. It can be deployed and managed like any other application on Plural.\n\n###### Info:\n\nThe admin console is separate from app.plural.sh which is primarily a package registry.\n\n[app.plural.sh](https://app.plural.sh)\n\n## Installation\n\n[](/getting-started/admin-console#installation)\n\n#### 1. Check your Git authentication method.\n\n[](/getting-started/admin-console#_1-check-your-git-authentication-method)\n\n```\n# show repo remote with details\ngit remote -v\n```\n\nIf the remote urls start with git@github.com then you're using SSH.\n\nIf the remote urls start with https then you're using HTTPS.\n\n#### 2. Setup for Git authentication\n\n[](/getting-started/admin-console#_2-setup-for-git-authentication)\n\nFollow the instructions here to generate a revokable personal access token (PAT). The access token needs to have write permissions. Keep track of this access token, you will need it later in the console install process. The PAT should have both push and pull permissions to the repository.\n\n[here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)\n\nIf you need to update your PAT you can go to the context.yaml file at the root of your repo and modify the access_token variable within the console block.\n\nFollow the instructions here if you are using GitHub to generate an SSH key and add it to your ssh-agent and GitHub account. The bundle install command below will then ask you to provide an SSH key and a valid path to the key you created.\n\n[here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)\n\nIf you need to update your SSH key for any reason (e.g. creating a new scoped deploy key) then update the private_key key in the console block of the context.yaml file at the root of your repo.\n\nIf you modified context.yaml to reconfigure your git auth, be sure to run:\n\n```\nplural build --only console ## wires the creds into the console helm chart from context.yaml\nplural deploy\n```\n\n#### 3. Install and build the Console\n\n[](/getting-started/admin-console#_3-install-and-build-the-console)\n\nThe plural console is installable like any other plural app. To find the available bundles, just run:\n\n```\nplural bundle list console\n```\n\nThen once you've found an eligible bundle to install, do:\n\n```\nplural bundle install console <bundle-name>\n```\n\nYou will now be guided through a configuration wizard. If you have any questions about a specific parameter, refer to this document.\n\n[this document](/applications/console)\n\nOnce the bundle has installed, run:\n\n```\nplural build\n```\n\nThe console takes over the gitops flow of managing plural apps for you. You will be asked for the git authentication credentials you created at Step 1.\n\n#### 4. Deploy Console\n\n[](/getting-started/admin-console#_4-deploy-console)\n\nOnce the build has completed, run:\n\n```\nplural deploy --commit \"installed console\"\n```\n\n#### 5. Login to Console\n\n[](/getting-started/admin-console#_5-login-to-console)\n\nOnce the deploy finishes, it will output the url that the console has been deployed to. Navigate to that url and it will show a login screen that looks like this:\n\n![Image](/assets/Screen%20Shot%202021-08-19%20at%203.54.54%20PM.png)\n\nIf you selected (y) to OIDC, one-login has already been configured, and you'll be able to sign in with the same credentials you use for app.plural.sh.\n\nIf you didn't select (y) to OIDC, your login credentials for this console are different from your login credentials for app.plural.sh. You can find them inconsole/helm/console/values.yaml under the console.secrets.admin_username and console.secrets.admin_password keys.\n\n## Console Highlights\n\n[](/getting-started/admin-console#console-highlights)\n\nThe Console is the command center for your Plural applications, and it comes with built-in goodies. Some highlights include:\n\n#### Application Overview\n\n[](/getting-started/admin-console#application-overview)\n\nThe first place you'll land in the Plural Console is the Application Overview. Here you can see all installed applications, along with their version and status. Clicking into an application shows all available dashboards, runbooks, an overview of components related to that application, cost analysis, user management, and configuration options.\n\nThe features in this section can be used to manage applications. As an example, select applications have interactive runbooks that serve as guided tutorials for advanced operations on Plural applications.\n\n![Image](/assets/basic-setup-and-deployment/application-runbook.png)\n\n#### Builds Overview\n\n[](/getting-started/admin-console#builds-overview)\n\nThe Builds Overview shows all scheduled, running, and completed builds. Completed builds will display the status of that build, and clicking into an individual build shows the build output and available actions to take.\n\n#### Nodes Overview\n\n[](/getting-started/admin-console#nodes-overview)\n\nThe Nodes Overview gives you an overview of your Kubernetes cluster, including total memory and CPU reservation, as well as the detail on each individual node.\n\nClicking on a node shows the pods assigned to that node, along with metadata and events associated with that node.\n\n#### Pods Overview\n\n[](/getting-started/admin-console#pods-overview)\n\nThe Pods Overview gives a filterable list of pods, their status, and running containers. Pod details give more information on containers, conditions, available metadata, and access to logs.\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/getting-started/admin-console.md)",

At the end of this tutorial, you will have:\n\nProvisioned a virtual shell loaded with the dependencies to run Plural.Created a Plural GitHub repository to store your configuration in.Provisioned a fully-configured Kubernetes cluster.Installed an application and all its dependencies on your Kubernetes cluster.\n\nin under 30 minutes, all within your browser. You can see the process in the video here or follow the instructions step-by-step, esp for unique cloud providers:\n\n## Login and Create the Plural Repository\n\n[](/getting-started/cloud-shell-quickstart#login-and-create-the-plural-repository)\n\nOnce you're logged in, you'll land on the Clusters Overview page. You can click on the \"Start onboarding\" button to kick off your onboarding process in your shell app.plural.sh/shell.\n\n[app.plural.sh/shell](https://app.plural.sh/shell)\n\n### Set up a Cloud Provider\n\n[](/getting-started/cloud-shell-quickstart#set-up-a-cloud-provider)\n\nChoose either the option to set up Plural using your own cloud credentials, or try our free 6-hour GCP sandbox demo. If you use your own cloud credentials, choose our Cloud Shell setup option. If you'd prefer to use the CLI, choose \"Local terminal\" and switch to the CLI quickstart.\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/setup-options.png)\n\nYou'll then be prompted to OAuth with either GitHub or GitLab. We're just getting your permission to create a repository for Plural configuration on your behalf. Give your repository a name, being sure to select the right organization or individual account in the first box. Your repository name must be unique within your account, which will be checked before you can advance to the next step.\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/github-config.png)\n\nPlural can be set up on AWS, GCP, or Azure. You can provide your credentials in the following screen:\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/cloud-provider-info.png)\n\nEach cloud provider requires a slightly different set of credentials. Follow the steps below to generate the credentials for your provider.\n\nFor AWS, you'll need to create or use a user with AdministratorAccess and create an access key for Plural to use.\n\nTo create a new user, navigate to the IAM section of your AWS Console.\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/iam-aws.png)\n\nSelect the Users tab and click Add users. You should see the following screen:\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/create-user.png)\n\nFill in the details for your user. On the \"Set permissions\" screen, you can either choose to add your user to a group with AdministratorAccess, or attach the AdministratorAccess policy directly.\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/administrator-access-aws.png)\n\nReview your user and hit the \"Create user\" button. Navigate to your newly created user and click the \"Security credentials\" tab. Find the section for Access keys and click \"Create access key\". You should see the following:\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/access-keys-aws.png)\n\nChoose \"Command Line Interface\", optionally add a tag, and create your access key. Make sure to download and save your new credentials; you can then enter the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key in your Plural onboarding.\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/aws-plural-config.png)\n\nFor GCP, you'll want to create a service account with the Owner role and generate an access key for Plural to use.\n\nTo create a new service account, navigate to the \"Service Accounts\" section of your GCP Console.\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/service-accounts-gcp.png)\n\nSelect the \"Create Service Account\" from the top banner. You should see the following input fields:\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/gcp-service-account-fields.png)\n\nFill in the details for your user. On the second step, add the Owner role for your service account.\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/gcp-owner-service-account.png)\n\nFinish creating your service account, and you should see your new service account in the Service Accounts home page. Click the three dots at the end of the row and select \"Manage keys\" like in the screenshot below:\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/create-keys-gcp.png)\n\nSelect \"Add Key\" and save the generated file. This will be used to configure your GCP credentials in your Plural onboarding.\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/gcp-plural-config.png)\n\nYou can either follow along with the text instructions here or use the following video to set up your Azure installation on Plural.\n\nFor Azure, you'll need various fields including your Client ID, Client Secret, Subscription ID, Tenant ID, Resource Group, and Storage Account.\n\nTo find your Subscription ID, navigate to the home page of your Azure console and search for \"Subscriptions\". You should see a page like the following:\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/subscriptions-azure.png)\n\nYour Subscription ID should be visible next to the Subscription name.\n\nNext, navigate to the Azure Active Directory section. Your Tenant ID should be displayed under \"Basic information\".\n\nFinally, navigate to the App registrations tab within your Directory. You should see an option to add a new registration:\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/app-registrations-azure.png)\n\nClick to add a new registration. Fill in the details for your registration as indicated below and click the \"Register\" button.\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/registration-details-azure.png)\n\nYour new App Registration should then be displayed. The displayed \"Application (client) ID\" will be the Client ID in your Plural configuration. Click on the option \"Add a certificate or secret\" of Client credentials. Select \"New client secret\" from the screen:\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/new-client-secret-azure.png)\n\nSet your preferred timeframe and generate your new secret. The \"Value\" field will be the Client Secret in your Plural configuration.\n\nYou can optionally navigate to the Resource groups section of your Azure console to retrieve a Resource Group and Storage Account, or you can enter new values in the Plural configuration which can create them for you.\n\nFrom here, you have two options. You either need to give your app a role on either your overall Subscription or scoped to a Resource Group. As an example, navigate to the Access Control (IAM) tab of your Subscription. Click the \"Role Assignments\" tab and Select \"Add\" at the top.\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/ra-azure.png)\n\nSelect the Owner role, and click on \"Select members\" to search for your app name. Select the app and continue until your new Role assignment is complete. You should now see your app listed as an owner for the Subscription. The process is the same if choosing to scope to a Resource Group.\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/completed-role-assignments-azure.png)\n\nReturn to your Plural onboarding. Enter the values noted above into your Cloud Credential configuration, and proceed to the next step.\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/azure-plural-config.png)\n\n### Set up a Workspace\n\n[](/getting-started/cloud-shell-quickstart#set-up-a-workspace)\n\nWe'll now start setting up your Kubernetes cluster configuration. Here's a guide to the config:\n\ncluster: The name of your Kubernetes cluster. Name this based on what you're planning to run.\n\nbucket prefix: We provision S3 buckets for storing logs and state. Enter any string to help us uniquely name your buckets.\n\nsubdomain: We'll provision a subdomain for you to host your cluster and applications under. For example, if you choose nintendo as your subdomain and spin up an instance of Airflow, it will be available at airflow.nintendo.onplural.sh.\n\nYou should hit the following verification screen afterward. Hit Create once you're ready to go!\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/cloud-shell-config.png)\n\nWhile your Cloud Shell is provisioning, double check that your repository was initialized by checking your GitHub repos. There should be a repository with an initial commit with the name that you configured.\n\n## Install Wizard and Cloud Shell\n\n[](/getting-started/cloud-shell-quickstart#install-wizard-and-cloud-shell)\n\nYou'll be redirected into your Cloud Shell environment after confirmation. Your Cloud Shell is where you can install applications, inspect your workspace, and run terminal commands.\n\nThe left-hand side of the screen is the Install Wizard, where you can configure applications for installation. Applications can be configured and installed in a fully point-and-click manner by following the available prompts. When Plural is installing your applications, you can follow progress on the right-hand side of the screen in the terminal window.\n\nThe terminal window is an interactive shell where you can follow along with installation progress and optionally run any additional commands you need to set up your Plural instance.\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/cloud-shell-applications.png)\n\n### Select Applications\n\n[](/getting-started/cloud-shell-quickstart#select-applications)\n\nOnce you have successfully booted into your Cloud Shell, you can configure and install applications.\n\nIn the Install Wizard on the left-hand side of the screen, choose the applications you want to install on your cluster. This will add these applications and their dependencies to the configuration flow, shown at the top of the Install Wizard.\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/cloud-shell-applications.png)\n\nYou'll now be guided through a setup wizard for the applications you chose. For help with Plural Console configuration, refer to this guide for explanations on each step. For help with configuring Airflow, refer to this guide. Required fields are indicated with a star and will appear in red until they've been populated. Many fields have default values populated; you can use those defaults or provide your own inputs. Any steps without required configuration will be auto-skipped.\n\n[this guide](/applications/console)\n\n[this guide](/applications/airflow)\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/airbyte-configuration.png)\n\nAfter configuration, you'll be provided with an overview screen of exactly which applications will be installed. When you're happy with the configuration, click Install to proceed.\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/applications-install-confirm.png)\n\n## Provision the Kubernetes Cluster and Install Applications\n\n[](/getting-started/cloud-shell-quickstart#provision-the-kubernetes-cluster-and-install-applications)\n\nNow it's time for Plural to write all the Helm and Terraform required to bring up your Kubernetes cluster based on the config that you've entered. When you click install, Plural will be running the commands to build and deploy your cluster. Your terminal window will display the output from these ongoing operations.\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/terminal-output.png)\n\nNow grab a coffee or your favorite hot beverage while we wait for your cloud provider to provision your infrastructure.\n\nWhen your applications are finished installing, you'll be able to see the domains for each application in the terminal window, and you can launch them once all components are ready.\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/application-domains.png)\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n[](/getting-started/cloud-shell-quickstart#troubleshooting)\n\nOccasionally errors can crop up during the build and deploy process. If your build or deploy fails, you can try re-running the commands to see if it resolves an intermittent issue. To do this, click into the terminal window and either tap the up arrow key to see the last command or type in plural build && plural deploy --commit \"deploying a few apps with plural\" to relaunch the process from where it left off and commit your changes when finished.\n\nIf errors persist, check out our Troubleshooting documentation or reach out to us on our community Discord for help.\n\n[Troubleshooting documentation](/debugging/common-errors)\n\n[reach out to us on our community Discord](https://discord.gg/pluralsh)\n\n## Check out your Deployments\n\n[](/getting-started/cloud-shell-quickstart#check-out-your-deployments)\n\n### Plural Console\n\n[](/getting-started/cloud-shell-quickstart#plural-console)\n\nOnce your cluster has completed deployment, click the Launch Console button to head over to console.YOUR_WORKSPACE.onplural.sh (or the hostname you picked) and view the console that you have provisioned. If you enabled Plural OIDC, you'll be able to quickly login using your Plural account.\n\nHere, you'll be able to check node health, Pod health, logs, pre-built dashboards tailored for Airflow, and more.\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/console-example.png)\n\n### Airflow / Other Applications\n\n[](/getting-started/cloud-shell-quickstart#airflow-other-applications)\n\nTo access your Airflow installation, access it similarly to the console at airflow.YOUR_WORKSPACE.onplural.sh\n\n![Image](/assets/cloud-shell-quickstart/image-7.png)\n\nYou can now access your DAGs from the GitHub repo that you set up earlier. Just add any DAGs you want to use the repo and a sync will run every 5 minutes or so to pull them in.\n\nAccessing other applications deployed on Plural will work exactly the same way.\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\n[](/getting-started/cloud-shell-quickstart#wrapping-up)\n\nNow that we've set up a running cluster with Plural, we can add and remove applications to our existing cluster as we so choose.\n\n### Uninstalling Applications\n\n[](/getting-started/cloud-shell-quickstart#uninstalling-applications)\n\nTo uninstall an application from your cluster, run the following in your Cloud Shell:\n\n```\nplural destroy <app-name>\n```\n\n### Deleting your Cluster and Resetting the Cloud Shell\n\n[](/getting-started/cloud-shell-quickstart#deleting-your-cluster-and-resetting-the-cloud-shell)\n\nTo fully delete your Plural Cluster, run the following in your Cloud Shell:\n\n```\nplural destroy\n```\n\nThis will tear down your Plural Cluster and all attached installations.\n\nTo also delete the Cloud Shell itself (e.g., to change Cloud Providers or restart onboarding), click the three dots on the upper-right side of the Cloud Shell and select Delete cloud shell. This will bring up a confirmation prompt; enter \"delete\" to wipe your shell and restart onboarding from the beginning.\n\n### Leaving the Shell Experience\n\n[](/getting-started/cloud-shell-quickstart#leaving-the-shell-experience)\n\nIf you want to start using the CLI locally, just install the Plural CLI and run:\n\n[install the Plural CLI](/getting-started/quickstart#install-plural-cli)\n\n```\nplural shell sync\n```\n\nThis will sync your local installation with the Cloud Shell. You can then proceed to purge the shell if you wish to spin it down:\n\n```\nplural shell purge\n```\n\n### Feedback\n\n[](/getting-started/cloud-shell-quickstart#feedback)\n\nIf you have any feedback or questions about the experience, head over to our community Discord and drop us some feedback. The Cloud Shell is still in development and we are dedicated to perfecting the user experience, so any feedback would be immensely helpful to us.\n\n[head over to our community Discord](https://discord.gg/pluralsh)\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/getting-started/cloud-shell-quickstart.md)",

Stacks are collections of bundles (i.e., a one-shot installation of a set of applications with a guided configuration experience).\n\nAn installation is a specific deployment of an application onto a cluster. As an example, an organization can have multiple installations of the same application on different clusters.\n\nPlural OIDC (OpenID Connect) is a form of\u00a0SSO\u00a0that enables Plural users to add an authentication layer on top of any apps they deploy with Plural. Instead of using the application's normal login screen,\u00a0you are instead prompted to login with Plural.

All CLI commands will work in the Cloud Shell, and currently each Cloud Shell instance is tied to a single cluster and account.\n\nThe Plural CLI is a command line interface that can be used to run all Plural commands locally.\n\nThe Console is a web application created by Plural that runs within a cluster deployed by Plural. The Console serves as a control panel for all your Plural applications by managing automated upgrades delivered from the Kubernetes API, showing application metrics and logs, serving as a built-in K8s dashboard, and being the touchpoint for incidents which can be filed with the owner of an application.\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/getting-started/concepts.md)",

To manage versioning safely, we use a GitOps practice that requires you to store these files in their own Git repository.\n\nIf you are using the Plural Cloud Shell, we handle setting this up for you.\n\n[Plural Cloud Shell](https://app.plural.sh/shell)\n\n###### Info:\n\nCurrently we're limited to a one cluster to one repo mapping, but eventually that will be relaxed. We also strongly urge users to store installations in a fresh, separate repository to avoid our automation trampling existing files.\n\nPlural currently supports the following version control providers:\n\nGitHubGitLabBitbucket (Follow Manual Git Setup below to use Bitbucket)\n\n[GitHub](https://github.com/)\n\n[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)\n\n[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/)\n\nSupport for the following providers is on our roadmap:\n\nMercurial\n\n[Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/)\n\nYou have two options when setting up a Git repository for use with a Plural workspace:\n\nUsing Plural OAuth by running plural init anywhere.

Then, run:\n\n```\nplural init\n```\n\nThis will kick off the process of setting up your Plural workspace. Once you've gone through a few setup steps, you'll get the following prompt:? you're attempting to setup plural outside a git repository. would you like us to set one up for you here?\n\nEnter Y, pick your version control provider of choice, and you will receive an OAuth screen to let Plural create and manage repositories on your behalf. Note, Plural can only manage repositories that it has created.\n\nIf everything goes well, it should look like this:\n\n![Image](/assets/basic-setup-and-deployment/gitops-terminal.png)\n\n## Manual Git Setup\n\n[](/getting-started/manage-git-repositories/setting-up-gitops#manual-git-setup)\n\nSupported for: (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)\n\nTo set up a Git repository yourself, you'll need a fresh repository with the following requirements:\n\nCloned with SSHMust have an initial commitMust be in sync with the upstream/origin repository\n\nIf the requirements aren't fulfilled, you'll hit an error in the plural init setup process. To get started, follow these steps:\n\nAnd you should be good to go!\n\n## GitOps Best Practices\n\n[](/getting-started/manage-git-repositories/setting-up-gitops#gitops-best-practices)\n\nPlural has three basic steps to the deploy process:\n\nWhen plural build is completed, you'll notice all of your new configuration has been created in your local repository. In this state, the files are not yet committed or pushed up to your origin repository.\n\nYou can manually commit and push the files yourself, but we recommend using the --commit CLI argument when running plural deploy\n\n```\nplural deploy --commit \"deploying console and dagster\"\n```\n\nThis will commit and push up your configuration changes for you to your origin repository, using the commit message you've specified.\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/getting-started/manage-git-repositories/setting-up-gitops.md)",

We currently support AWS, GCP and Azure. Follow this guide to make sure it's set up correctly.Your cloud provider CLI installed and configured: Plural will leverage your cloud provider's CLI tooling in places. If need to install the cloud provider CLI, or aren't sure if it's properly configured you can follow this guide.A GitHub/GitLab account: Plural manages the state of your infrastructure using a git-ops workflow, so you'll need an account with a version control management system. Follow the instructions in our GitOps resources for more information.\n\n[this guide](/reference/configuring-cloud-provider)\n\n[this guide](/reference/configuring-cloud-provider)\n\n[in our GitOps resources](/getting-started/manage-git-repositories/setting-up-gitops)\n\n## Install Plural CLI\n\n[](/getting-started/quickstart#install-plural-cli)\n\nThe Plural CLI and its dependencies are available using a package manager for your system. For Mac, we recommend using Homebrew. For other operating systems, curl and our Docker image should work universally.\n\n[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)\n\nThe brew tap will install Plural, alongside Terraform, Helm and kubectl for you. If you've already installed any of those dependencies, you can add --without-helm, --without-terraform, or --without-kubectl\n\n```\nbrew install pluralsh/plural/plural\n```\n\n###### Warning:\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure that your cloud provider CLI is properly configured and updated to the latest version. If you aren't sure about how to do that, refer to this guide. If it is not configured correctly, Plural will fail and won't be able to create resources on your behalf.\n\n[this guide](/reference/configuring-cloud-provider)\n\nYou can download the binaries attached to our GitHub releases here. There will be binaries for linux, windows, and mac and all compatible platforms.\n\n[here](https://github.com/pluralsh/plural-cli/releases)\n\nFor example, you can download v0.6.2 for Darwin arm64 via:\n\n```\nVSN=$(curl --silent -qI https://github.com/pluralsh/plural-cli/releases/latest | awk -F '/' '/^location/ {print  substr($NF, 1, length($NF)-1)}')\ncurl -L -o plural.tgz 'https://github.com/pluralsh/plural-cli/releases/download/${VSN}/plural-cli_${VSN#v}_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz'\ntar -xvf plural.tgz\nchmod +x plural\nmv plural /usr/local/bin/plural\n```\n\n###### Info:\n\nBe sure to download the CLI version for your target OS/architecture, the above example is only valid for ARM Mac's\n\nYou will still need to ensure helm, terraform and kubectl are properly installed, you can find installers for each here\n\n[https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)\n\n[https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)\n\n[https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)\n\n###### Warning:\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure that your cloud provider CLI is properly configured and updated to the latest version.

If it is not configured correctly, Plural will fail and won't be able to create resources on your behalf.\n\n[this guide](/reference/configuring-cloud-provider)\n\n## Create your Plural Repo\n\n[](/getting-started/quickstart#create-your-plural-repo)\n\nPlural stores all configuration artifacts within a Git repository that we will create on your behalf. Run this command within the directory that you want to store your configuration in:\n\n```\nplural init\n```\n\nThe Plural CLI will then guide you through a workflow using GitHub/GitLab OAuth to create a repository on your behalf.\n\n###### Info:\n\nIf you'd prefer to set up Git manually vs. using OAuth, refer to our guide on setting up Gitops.\n\n[setting up Gitops](/getting-started/manage-git-repositories/setting-up-gitops)\n\nAlong the plural init workflow, we will set the Git attributes to configure encryption and configure your cloud provider for this installation.\n\nYou will also be asked whether you want to use Plural's domain service and if so, what you want the subdomain to be. We recommend that you use our DNS service if you don't have any security reasons that prevent you from doing so. The hostname that you configure with us will determine where your applications are hosted. For example, if you enter singular.onplural.sh, your applications will be available at $APP_NAME.singular.onplural.sh.\n\nThis process will generate a workspace.yaml file at the root of your repo that stores your cloud provider configuration information.\n\n###### Info:\n\nCurrently we're limited to a one cluster to one repo mapping, but eventually that will be relaxed. We also strongly urge users to store installations in a fresh, separate repository to avoid our automation trampling existing files.\n\n## Install Plural Applications\n\n[](/getting-started/quickstart#install-plural-applications)\n\nTo view the applications you can install on Plural, head to this link.\n\n[this link](https://app.plural.sh/explore/public)\n\nOnce you've selected your applications, you can install Plural bundles using our interactive GUI. To start the GUI, run:\n\n```\nplural install\n```\n\nYou should see a window pop up like the below:\n\n![Image](/assets/cli-quickstart/local-installer.png)\n\nYou can then follow a guided flow to select and configure your applications.\n\nAlternatively, you can run plural repos list on the CLI or Cloud Shell and find the bundle name specific to your cloud provider.\n\nRun plural bundle list <app-name> to find installation commands and information about each application available for install. For example, to list the bundle information for the Plural console, a powerful Kubernetes control plane:\n\nHere's what we get from running plural bundle list console:\n\n```\n+-------------+--------------------------------+----------+--------------------------------+\n|    NAME     |          DESCRIPTION           | PROVIDER |        INSTALL COMMAND         |\n+-------------+--------------------------------+----------+--------------------------------+\n| console-aws | Deploys console on an EKS      | AWS      | plural bundle install console  |\n|             | cluster                        |          | console-aws                    |\n+-------------+--------------------------------+----------+--------------------------------+\n```\n\nTo install applications on Plural, run:\n\n```\nplural bundle install <app-name> <bundle-name>\n```\n\nWe can try this out by installing the Plural Console:\n\n```\nplural bundle install console console-aws\n```\n\n```\nplural bundle install console console-gcp\n```\n\n```\nplural bundle install console console-azure\n```\n\nAs of CLI version 0.6.19, the bundle name can be inferred from primary bundles, optionally shortening the command to:\n\n```\nplural bundle install console\n```\n\nAfter running the install command, you will be asked a few questions about how your app will be configured, including whether you want to enable Plural OIDC (single sign-on). Unless you don't wish to use Plural as an identity provider due to internal company security requirements, you should enter (Y). This will enable you to use your existing app.plural.sh login information to access Plural-deployed applications. This will add an extra layer of security for applications without built-in authentication.\n\nUltimately all the values you input at this step will be stored in a file called context.yaml at the root of your repo.\n\n## Build and Deploy your Kubernetes Cluster and Applications\n\n[](/getting-started/quickstart#build-and-deploy-your-kubernetes-cluster-and-applications)\n\nWith all bundles installed, run:\n\n```\nplural build\nplural deploy --commit \"initial deploy\"\n```\n\nThis will generate all deployment artifacts in the repo, then deploy them in dependency order.\n\nIt is common for plural deploy to take a fair amount of time, as is the case with most Terraform and cloud infrastructure deployments. Network disconnects can cause potential issues as a result. If you're running on a spotty network, or would like to step out while it's running we recommend running it in tmux.\n\n[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)\n\nOnce plural deploy has completed, you should be ready to log in to your application at {app-name}.{domain-name}.\n\n###### Warning:\n\nYou may experience a delayed creation of your SSL certs for your applications. ZeroSSL currently may take up to 24 hours to provide you your certs.\n\nAnd you are done! You now have a fully-configured Kubernetes cluster and are free to install applications on it to your heart's content. If you want to take down any of your individual applications, run plural destroy <APP-NAME>. If you're just testing us out and want to take down the entire thing, run plural destroy.\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/getting-started/quickstart.md)",

        "text": "# Introduction\n\nPlural empowers you to build and maintain production-ready applications on Kubernetes in minutes with no management overhead.\n\n## What is Plural?\n\n[](/introduction#what-is-plural)\n\nPlural is an open-source, unified, application deployment platform that stands up a Kubernetes cluster and selected applications in the cloud provider of your choice. Plural stores your infrastructure code and configuration in a fresh Git repository of your choosing, which we refer to as a Plural workspace.\n\n[workspace](/getting-started/manage-git-repositories/your-plural-workspace)\n\nPlural writes all the Helm, Terraform, and YAML needed for your desired infrastructure with plural build, and deploys it all into production with plural deploy. All configuration within your Plural Git repository is fully ejectable from the platform and ecosystem.\n\n![Image](/assets/introduction/introduction-marketplace.png)\n\nSome key features of the platform include:\n\nAutomated UpgradesCross-tool dependency managementGitOps workflow with batteries-included transparent secret encryptionBuilt on common open-source tools, so if you don't like us, you can always eject your application from Plural and use it as you please.\n\nNotably, we do not support bringing your own Kubernetes cluster yet, but it's on our roadmap.\n\n## Deployment Options\n\n[](/introduction#deployment-options)\n\n### Plural CLI\n\n[](/introduction#plural-cli)\n\nThis is the current standard deployment method. Click below for a quickstart to managing configuration locally.\n\nQuickstart: Using the Plural CLI on your Machine\n\n[Quickstart: Using the Plural CLI on your Machine](/getting-started/quickstart)\n\n### Plural Cloud Shell\n\n[](/introduction#plural-cloud-shell)\n\nWe have created a Cloud Shell with all of the tools and dependencies needed to run Plural. This is available here to try out. If you want to try out Plural without entering cloud credentials, we offer a demo environment of our Plural Console that you can access here.\n\n[here](https://app.plural.sh/shell)\n\n[here](https://www.plural.sh/demo-login)\n\nUsing our in-browser Cloud Shell\n\n[Using our in-browser Cloud Shell](/getting-started/cloud-shell-quickstart)\n\nIf you need support getting your Plural deployment up and running, join the Plural Discord here!\n\n[Plural Discord here!](https://discord.gg/pluralsh)\n\n## Architecture\n\n[](/introduction#architecture)\n\nThe Plural architecture has three main components:\n\nPlural API and Catalog site (available at https://app.plural.sh)Plural CLI and Git SCM to maintain the state of a user's applicationsPlural Console for management of all plural applications on your infrastructure\n\n[https://app.plural.sh](https://app.plural.sh)\n\nAt a high level, the interactions between all three components look something like this:\n\n![Image](/assets/reference/architecture.png)\n\n### Plural API\n\n[](/introduction#plural-api)\n\nThe primary responsibility of the Plural API is to store the packages needed for application installation - terraform, helm - and ingesting high-level dependency information about them. This allows us to properly sequence installations. It also serves as a publish-subscribe layer to communicate updates to clusters that have installed those applications, and can leverage the dependency information ingested to delay updates until a cluster has caught up with all the necessary dependencies.\n\nIt also can serve as an identity provider for any Plural application, delegating authentication via OIDC and also maintaining user group info and communicating it down to applications.\n\n### Plural CLI\n\n[](/introduction#plural-cli)\n\nThe Plural CLI effectively uses the Plural API as a package manager, and works as a higher level build tool on top of the DevOps packages it supports. It will handle things like running installations in dependency order, detecting changes between runs, and templating out a workspace from scratch.\n\nIt also is responsible for managing secret encryption of all application state in plural installation repos and provides a few useful tools for troubleshooting an application our admin console might not be well-suited to solve.\n\nFinally it also provides the toolchain for publishing applications to the plural API.\n\n### Plural Console\n\n[](/introduction#plural-console)\n\nThe Plural Console is the operational hub for all applications managed by Plural. It is deployed in-cluster alongside applications and provides a few key features:\n\nAutomated upgrades - by subscribing to the API's upgrade websocketObservability - leveraging the dashboard and logging Kubernetes CRDs deployed alongside Plural applicationsSupport - in-person support can be handled in our chat interface available directly in the admin console, with a lot of nice features like direct zoom integration\n\nIt's deployed as a highly available, scalable web service, with postgres as its datastore. It also directly integrates with Plural's OIDC for login and user management.\n\n## Docs Translations\n\n[](/introduction#docs-translations)\n\n### Japanese\n\n[](/introduction#japanese)\n\nThe wonderful team at St-Hakky has translated most of our docs to Japanese on their website.

This has a few implications:\n\nUsers should fix the cloud provider that identity is installing to, as a workspace for that users installation likely can't span multiple providersFor production-grade workloads where you'd like to have a full team managing an installation, it's typically better to use a Service Account to manage an installation.\n\nAny activity the Plural Console does against the Plural API is also authenticated as the installer's identity. So support tickets will usually be created using that user, and the upgrade websocket is created on behalf of that user. This makes a lot of things a lot simpler in a disconnected architecture like Plural's.\n\n### Publishing\n\n[](/operations/auth-access-control/identity-and-installations#publishing)\n\nMembers on a Plural account can become publishers if given the appropriate role, or if they are the account owner. Publishers have the ability to create application repositories, publish terraform or helm packages to repositories, and determine payment plans for applications.\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/operations/auth-access-control/identity-and-installations/index.md)",

For those users on paid tiers, Plural allows you to manage multiple clusters from a single UI.\n\n![Image](/assets/operations/multi-cluster.png)\n\nAdditional clusters are spun up using a unique Service Account for each new cluster. Service Accounts are assumable identities, specifically meant to facilitate group management of a set of installations. To spin up a new cluster, first create a new Service Account.\n\nTo create a service account, from https://app.plural.sh/, navigate to account, then service accounts.\n\n[https://app.plural.sh/](https://app.plural.sh/accounts/edit/service-accounts)\n\n![Image](/assets/advanced-topics/service-accounts-static.png)\n\nFrom here, you can create a new service account, and attach users or groups.\n\n![Image](/assets/advanced-topics/service-accounts-create.png)\n\nOnce created, you can impersonate the service account by clicking the impersonate button in the dashboard, or via the CLI:\n\n```\nplural login --service-account <service-account-email>\n```\n\nIn all other respects, service accounts behave just like normal Plural users, and will be present in audit logs, can be used in support chats, and, of course, can install and deploy applications just like users.\n\nYou can then create a new cluster on the Service Account via the Cloud Shell or CLI.\n\nThe Clusters tab on your main Plural account will show all clusters that you have access to. From here, you can manage user access, navigate to a cluster's Cloud Shell, set Upgrade Channels for applications, and more.\n\n## Setting up Promotions\n\n[](/operations/auth-access-control/identity-and-installations/service-accounts#setting-up-promotions)\n\nOne major benefit of setting up multiple clusters is the ability to promote versions of different applications between clusters. Assuming both clusters are on the same provider, you can try out new versions of applications in a development cluster, and promote to production when you're ready.\n\nYou can set up promotions either in the browser or via the Plural CLI.\n\n### CLI Setup\n\n[](/operations/auth-access-control/identity-and-installations/service-accounts#cli-setup)\n\nTo set up promotions via the CLI, you can first run plural clusters list to see all available clusters and associated IDs. From there, you can run:\n\n```\nplural clusters depend <source_cluster_ID> <destination_cluster_ID>\n```\n\nwhere source is your development cluster and destination is your production cluster.\n\nTo run a promotion, use:\n\n```\nplural clusters promote\n```\n\nThis will propagate versions for all apps from your source cluster to your destination cluster.\n\n### UI Setup\n\n[](/operations/auth-access-control/identity-and-installations/service-accounts#ui-setup)\n\nFor a full demonstration of in-browser cluster promotion, check out our demo video or read on below.\n\nTo do this from the Plural UI, navigate to the Clusters Overview tab. Choose the cluster you want as your destination cluster, and click into the Cluster details page.\n\nClick the \"Set up promotions\" button, select your source cluster, and click the Save button.\n\nYou can then click the \"Promote\" button to see pending upgrades and execute a promotion.\n\nAlternatively, you can promote from the Clusters Overview page by clicking the green checkmark in the clusters table.\n\n![Image](/assets/operations/promotion-modal.png)\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/operations/auth-access-control/identity-and-installations/service-accounts.md)",

The latter mode is helpful if you'd like a certain role to only be able to install, say, airflow and sentry.\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/operations/auth-access-control/index.md)",

This will involve editing the Terraform that we generate for you, which carries risks if administered incorrectly.\n\nIn general, all core cluster configuration is set up in a Terraform stack in the bootstrap app directory. You can find the Terraform code under bootstrap/terraform if you want to dive in yourself, but we can help guide you here as well.\n\n## Operations on node groups\n\n[](/operations/cluster-configuration#operations-on-node-groups)\n\n### Modifying node types\n\n[](/operations/cluster-configuration#modifying-node-types)\n\nModifying node types allows you to optimize the infrastructure backing your applications for cost and/or performance reasons.\n\nOn AWS, EKS has some interesting limitations around node groups. Since EBS doesn't support multi-AZ disks, to make node autoscaling work properly for stateful workloads, you need to split node groups across all availability zones deployed in a region. Some non-stateful workloads don't need this complexity, so we also have a set of multi-AZ groups as well. To modify either, simply update the aws-bootstrap module's single_az_node_groups or multi_az_node_groups configuration (in bootstrap/terraform/main.tf) with:\n\n```\nsingle_az_node_groups = {\n    my_node_group = {\n      name = \"my-node-group\"\n      capacity_type = \"ON_DEMAND\" # or SPOT\n      min_capacity = 3\n      desired_capacity = 3\n      instance_types = [\"t3.large\", \"t3a.large\"] # or whatever other types you'd like\n      k8s_labels = {\n        \"plural.sh/capacityType\" = \"ON_DEMAND\"\n        \"plural.sh/performanceType\" = \"BURST\"\n        \"plural.sh/scalingGroup\" = \"small-burst-on-demand\"\n      } # kubernetes labels are good for targeting workloads\n}\n```\n\nfor multi-AZ groups you can do the following:\n\n```\nmulti_az_node_groups = {\n    my_node_group = {\n      name = \"my-node-group\"\n      capacity_type = \"SPOT\"\n      instance_types = [\"t3.large\", \"t3a.large\"]\n      k8s_labels = {\n        \"plural.sh/capacityType\" = \"SPOT\"\n        \"plural.sh/performanceType\" = \"BURST\"\n        \"plural.sh/scalingGroup\" = \"small-burst-spot\"\n      }\n      k8s_taints = [{\n        key = \"plural.sh/capacityType\"\n        value = \"SPOT\"\n        effect = \"NO_SCHEDULE\"\n      }] # taints prevent a node from being schedulable unless a pod explicitly accepts it, good for preventing spot instances from being accidentally used\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOn GCP, update the gcp-bootstrap modules configuration (in bootstrap/terraform/main.tf) with:\n\n```\nnode_pools = [\n    {\n      name               = \"small-burst-on-demand\"\n      machine_type       = \"e2-standard-2\" # or whatever you'd like\n      min_count          = 1\n      max_count          = 9\n      disk_size_gb       = 50\n      disk_type          = \"pd-standard\"\n      image_type         = \"COS_CONTAINERD\"\n      spot               = false\n      auto_repair        = true\n      auto_upgrade       = true\n      preemptible        = false\n      initial_node_count = 1\n      autoscaling        = true\n    }\n]\n# if you'd like to add lables\nnode_pools_labels = {\n    \"small-burst-on-demand\" = {\n      \"plural.sh/capacityType\" = \"ON_DEMAND\"\n      \"plural.sh/performanceType\" = \"BURST\"\n      \"plural.sh/scalingGroup\" = \"small-burst-on-demand\"\n    }\n}\n# if you'd also like to add taints\nnode_pools_taints = {\n    small-burst-spot = [\n      {\n        key    = \"plural.sh/capacityType\"\n        value  = \"SPOT\"\n        effect = \"NO_SCHEDULE\"\n      },\n    ],\n}\n```\n\nCurrently Azure has an annoying chicken-egg issue with the requirement that at least one node pool must be created. Terraform manages this poorly by forcing cluster recreation if the default node pool changes. To ensure no instability, we strongly recommend you confirm any node topology changes do not interfere with the default node pool on the AKS cluster.\n\nWith Azure, update the azure-bootstrap modules configuration in bootstrap/terraform/main.tf with:\n\n```\nnode_groups =  [\n    {\n      name                = \"ssod1\"\n      priority            = \"Regular\"\n      enable_auto_scaling = true\n      availability_zones  = [\"1\"]\n      mode                = \"System\"\n      node_count          = null\n      min_count           = 1\n      max_count           = 9\n      spot_max_price      = null\n      eviction_policy     = null\n      vm_size             = \"Standard_D2as_v5\"\n      os_disk_type        = \"Managed\"\n      os_disk_size_gb     = 50\n      max_pods            = 110\n\n      node_labels = {\n        \"plural.sh/capacityType\" = \"ON_DEMAND\"\n        \"plural.sh/performanceType\" = \"SUSTAINED\"\n        \"plural.sh/scalingGroup\" = \"small-sustained-on-demand\"\n      } # or whatever labels you'd prefer\n      node_taints = [\n        # \"someTaintName\"\n      ]\n      tags = {\n        \"ScalingGroup\": \"small-sustained-on-demand\"\n      }\n    }\n]\n```\n\n## Adding users/roles [AWS]\n\n[](/operations/cluster-configuration#adding-users-roles-aws)\n\nBecause of the limitations set by AWS' IAM authenticator, you'll need to follow this process to add new users or roles to a cluster running in AWS.\n\nAdd these input to aws-bootstrap in bootstrap/terraform/main.tf\n\n```\nmap_users = [\n    {\n      userarn = \"arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:user/yourusername\"\n      username = \"yourusername\"\n      groups = [\"system:masters\"] # or whatever k8s group you'd prefer\n    }\n  ]\n\n# if you'd rather authenticate with an IAM role (a recommended approach), add this block\nmanual_roles = [\n    {\n      rolearn = \"arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/yourrolename\"\n      username = \"yourrolename\"\n      groups = [\"system:masters\"]\n    }\n]\n```\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/operations/cluster-configuration.md)",

        "text": "# Cost Optimization\n\nControlling the cost of your cluster and applications.\n\nOut of the box, Plural performs a lot of optimizations behind the scenes with our built-in autoscaler that schedules workloads efficiently across your infrastructure. However, there are some efforts you can make to monitor and optimize this cost.\n\n## Console Scaling Recommendations\n\n[](/operations/cost-management#console-scaling-recommendations)\n\nThe Plural Console offers scaling recommendations for certain apps, some of which can be immediately applied from the Console.\n\nTo do this, select your desired application from the Application Overview tab and then click on the Components tab in the sidebar on the left. Then click on the specific component you want to get recommendations for and you will see a Scaling button in the top right.\n\nWhen you click on the Scaling button, if you see Apply in the bottom right, you can immediately enforce the recommendations given by Plural.\n\n## Node Optimization\n\n[](/operations/cost-management#node-optimization)\n\n### Helping the Autoscaler\n\n[](/operations/cost-management#helping-the-autoscaler)\n\nThe Plural autoscaler does a good job of scheduling new Pods and resources onto nodes that can handle the extra workload, but cannot delete Pods, as it could lead to potentially destructive scenarios. Because of this, you may end up with imbalanced nodes that are overworked or underworked.\n\nTo address this, you'll need the Plural Console installed. Head to the Nodes tab in the sidebar on the left of the Console. Here, you'll see the utilization of resources for all of your nodes. You are looking for nodes that are overworked or underworked, which can be observed by seeing if cpu and/or memory is in the red (overworked) or close to zero and green (underworked).\n\nTo delete these nodes, hit the red trash can symbol to the right of the problematic node and it will deprovision, letting the autoscaler schedule the Pods it was running on a different node.\n\n###### Info:\n\nAs with any operations that involve taking down resources, you will likely encounter a small amount of downtime as your resources get rescheduled.\n\n### Node Sizing at Scale\n\n[](/operations/cost-management#node-sizing-at-scale)\n\nIf you deploy a lot of applications and resources, you may start seeing cost go up faster than expected due to the fixed cost of installing Kubernetes and its services on every node. This fixed Kubernetes tax per node varies based on your cloud provider. Essentially, if a small node is used, it will be a higher percentage of your usage than a large node, making the cost differences more evident at large scale with small node sizes.\n\nTo control this, it is recommended that you increase your node sizes to accommodate more resources and applications per node, reducing the amount of times you're paying the fixed cost for running Kubernetes. Learn how to modify your node types here.\n\n[here](/operations/cluster-configuration#modifying-node-types)\n\n## Kubecost\n\n[](/operations/cost-management#kubecost)\n\nTo monitor your cost and keep an eye out for spend, you can install Kubecost on Plural just how you would install any other application. Check out their documentation here.\n\n[Kubecost](/applications/kubecost)\n\n[here](https://docs.kubecost.com/)\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/operations/cost-management.md)",

Here's what each of the settings mean:\n\nLatest: Everytime the Plural team tests and publishes a new release, you receive it.Stable: You only receive versions that have passed a set of Plural determined tests.None: You never receive automatic updates and have to manually update your application versions or change this setting.\n\nYou can change this setting in the App settings menu, accessible from each cluster's details page. You can dive into each cluster from the Clusters Overview page https://app.plural.sh/overview/clusters.\n\n[https://app.plural.sh/overview/clusters](https://app.plural.sh/overview/clusters)\n\n![Image](/assets/operations/update-application.png)\n\n## Rollback to a previous version\n\n[](/operations/managing-applications/update-application#rollback-to-a-previous-version)\n\nThis requires having the Plural Console installed. We'll need this to create an upgrade policy that tells Plural to not deploy an upgrade to your application, which is normally performed automatically unless disabled using the setting in our app. You could just disable upgrades altogether in the application as stated above, but then you'd lose out on easy upgrade delivery later.\n\n[Plural Console installed](/getting-started/admin-console)\n\nFirst, navigate to the Plural Console and select the Builds tab.\n\nClick on the gear icon in the top right to enter the Upgrade Policy section and then click Create More.\n\nHere is an example for a policy that will require approval before runninng plural deploy for Airflow.\n\n![Image](/assets/operations/airflow-approval-policy.png)\n\nThen head back to our marketplace, go to the repository page for your installed application, and click the Packages section in the sidebar. This will allow you to pick Helm charts and Terraform modules that correspond to previously deployed versions of your application.\n\n[marketplace](https://app.plural.sh/marketplace)\n\nOnce you click on the Helm chart, the associated application version for the Helm chart is displayed in the CHART.YAML section on the right. On the left will be a drop-down menu showing which version you are currently on. Scroll through the chart versions to find the application version that you want to rollback to. Then click Install in the top right.\n\nWe'll be honest. This process isn't ideal, so we're working on a simple rollback command in our CLI.\n\n## How Plural updates app versions\n\n[](/operations/managing-applications/update-application#how-plural-updates-app-versions)\n\nWe use a tool called Renovate to automate the updating of application version images. Renovate creates pull requests against our plural-artifacts GitHub repository to perform these updates on a regular basis. Here is an example of one of those PRs.\n\n[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate)\n\n[Here](https://github.com/pluralsh/plural-artifacts/pull/236)\n\nOnce we have tried out the changes and have confirmed that the new version is stable, we will merge the PR and the change will be available for all Plural installations to pull down when they wish to.\n\nOccasionally, we do manually update these versions to pull in application changes more quickly. If a current version is breaking user workflows or if a new version of an application is heavily requested, we will manually perform this operation.\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/operations/managing-applications/update-application.md)",

        "text": "# Network Configuration\n\nIn your infrastructure, Plural will create a VPC, a public ingress controller, and a private ingress controller. Sometimes your organization or project will want to change our networking defaults to better suit your deployment.\n\n## VPC Subnet configuration\n\n[](/operations/network-configuration#vpc-subnet-configuration)\n\nYou\u2019ll want to overwrite our default subnet configuration if you need to add the VPC that Plural creates to any adjacent VPCs/networks in your infrastructure.\n\nFrequently, VPC peering APIs require all subnets to be non-overlapping, which isn't guaranteed from our defaults. This can always be updated in bootstrap/terrraform/main.tf (As a reference, CIDR blocks follow this format: 10.xx.xx.xx/yy, the examples below are placeholders.)\n\nOn AWS, update the aws-bootstrap modules configuration with:\n\n```\npublic_subnets = [\"your.cidr.pub.1\", \"your.cidr.pub.2\", \"your.cidr.pub.3\"]\nprivate_subnets = [\"your.cidr.priv.1\", \"your.cidr.priv.2\", \"your.cidr.priv.3\"]\nworker_private_subnets = [\"your.cidr.worker.1\", \"your.cidr.worker.2\", \"your.cidr.worker.3\"]\n```\n\nOn GCP, update the gcp-bootstrap modules configuration with:\n\n```\nvpc_subnetwork_cidr_range = \"your.cidr\"\n\n# you might also want to update cluster_secondary_range_cidr\n# and services_secondary_range_cidr\n```\n\nWith Azure, update the azure-bootstrap modules configuration with:\n\n```\naddress_space = \"your.cidr\"\nsubnet_prefixes = [\"your.cidr.pref\"]\n```\n\n###### Warning:\n\nNote that updating these will likely cause the VPC to be replaced, which will recreate your cluster. We recommend that you destroy your cluster before applying network config modifications to it.\n\n[destroy your cluster](/operations/uninstall)\n\n## Configuring VPC Peering\n\n[](/operations/network-configuration#configuring-vpc-peering)\n\nPlural creates a fresh VPC and Kubernetes cluster for deploying applications. This ensures that we have a clean environment to deploy into and minimizes disruption to existing systems. It does come with the tradeoff of slightly increased network complexity, but most cloud providers can bridge this using VPC peering. This is a technology that effectively allows you to combine the address spaces of two VPCs in the cloud you operate in.\n\nThere is a caveat: the VPCs should have no overlapping subnets in addition to some other complexities per cloud provider. Refer to the guide above on subnet configuration before proceeding.\n\nPlural makes it easy to add additional Terraform to the stacks we generate. Effectively, as long as you don\u2019t modify the [main.tf](http://main.tf) file at the root of a Terraform folder, or any of the module folders, we\u2019ll preserve your Terraform between builds and apply it for you appropriately as changes arise. For configuring a VPC peer, let\u2019s create a new Terraform file called [network.tf](http://network.tf) and drop the configuration in there for your respective cloud:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_vpc_peering_connection\" \"foo\" {\n   peer_owner_id = \"my-owner-id\" # Use appropriate values here.\n   peer_vpc_id   = \"peer-vpc-id\"\n   vpc_id        = module.aws-bootstrap.vpc.id\n}\n```\n\n```\ndata \"google_compute_network\" \"peer\" {\n   name = \"peer-network\"\n}\n\nresource \"google_compute_network_peering\" \"peering1\" {\n   name         = \"plrl-peer\"\n   network      = module.gcp-bootstrap.vpc_network.self_link\n   peer_network = data.google_compute_network.peer.self_link\n}\n```\n\n```\ndata \"azure_rm_virtual_network\" \"peer\" {\n   resource_group_name = \"your-azure-resource-group\" # Use appropriate values here.\n   name = \"peer-network-name\"\n}\n\nresource \"azurerm_virtual_network_peering\" \"example-1\" {\n   name                      = \"plrl-peer\"\n   resource_group_name       = \"your-azure-resource-group\"\n   virtual_network_name      = module.azure-bootstrap.network.name\n   remote_virtual_network_id = data.azurerm_virtual_network.peer.id\n}\n```\n\n###### Warning:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, consult the section on customizing subnets to ensure your vpc subnets don\u2019t overlap when attempting to peer to existing networks.\n\n## Adding an IP Allowlist to the Public Ingress Controller\n\n[](/operations/network-configuration#adding-an-ip-allowlist-to-the-public-ingress-controller)\n\nPlural ships with two ingress controllers, both using the open-source ingress-nginx project. Some users might want to restrict what IPs the public ingress is available on. For example, this is required for locking it down to an office VPN. We can implement this by updating Kubernetes' loadBalancerSourceRanges attribute on LoadBalancer services. To configure this, head to your Plural repository and modify ingress-nginx/helm/ingress-nginx/values.yaml by overlaying:\n\n[ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx)\n\n```\ningress-nginx:\n  ingress-nginx:\n    controller:\n      service:\n        loadBalancerSourceRanges:\n          - cidr.1\n          - cidr.2\n        annotations:\n          # this is only needed for aws\n          service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-target-group-attributes: preserve_client_ip.enabled=true\n```\n\nOnce that\u2019s updated, run plural deploy --commit \"adding ip allowlist\" and it will update the service for you and push the changes upstream to your git repository.\n\nFor many users this will be sufficient, but some may prefer the application not have a public network address at all. In this case, check out the next section on using our private ingress controller.\n\n## Using our Private Ingress Controller\n\n[](/operations/network-configuration#using-our-private-ingress-controller)\n\nIf you only want your application directly addressable on a private network via ingress, e.g. if simply allowlisting source IPs is not secure enough for you, you can rewire an application to use our internal ingress controller. In general, you need to do a little diving to find exactly how the application\u2019s Helm chart configures its ingresses, and modify it to wire in the internal-nginx ingress class. Then run plural deploy --commit \"update app to use private ingress\" and it\u2019ll apply for you.\n\nLet's use Dagster as an example. To make Dagster only use the private ingress, apply this yaml on dagster/helm/dagster/values.yaml:\n\n```\ndagster:\n  dagster:\n    ingress:\n      annotations:\n        kubernetes.io/ingress.class: 'internal-nginx'\n```\n\nSometimes an application will require you to update an attribute called ingressClass. This will depend on whether the Helm chart is still using the legacy annotation-based ingress class flag or if it has migrated to the new first-class spec field.\n\nWe\u2019ll also build out configuration overlays in our console in the \u201cConfiguration\u201d tab to edit these, so you don\u2019t have to scavenge for the exact yaml update to do this, although that\u2019s still WIP.\n\n###### Warning:\n\nWe\u2019ve occasionally seen it take some time for the ingress controllers to swap classes. If you want to accelerate that, you can run kubectl delete ingress <ingress-name> -n <app-name> then plural bounce <app-name> to speed things along. You can usually find the ingresses in the components tab in our console.\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/operations/network-configuration.md)",

Verify your active configuration with\n\n```\n> gcloud config configurations list\nNAME                  IS_ACTIVE  ACCOUNT              PROJECT               COMPUTE_DEFAULT_ZONE  COMPUTE_DEFAULT_REGION\npersonalprj           False      yirenlu92@gmail.com  personalprj           us-east1-b            us-east1\nexample-project-name  True       yirenlu92@gmail.com  example-project-name  us-east1-b            us-east1\n```\n\nTo change the active configuration run\n\n```\n> gcloud config configurations activate example-project-name\nActivated [example-project-name].\n```\n\nTo refresh the login for this gcloud configuration run\n\n```\n> gcloud auth login\n```\n\nIn addition to the gcloud CLI, the Plural CLI, as well as the employed GCP Terraform providers, also use the gcloud SDK. So you will also need to setup Application Default Credentials. Make sure to use the same account as you used to authenticate your active gcloud CLI configuration!\n\n[Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/login)\n\n```\n> gcloud auth application-default login\n```\n\nFailure to do this could result in project requested not found or permission related errors further along.\n\nFollow the instructions here to install your Azure CLI.Follow the instructions here to sign into your Azure CLI.\n\n[here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)\n\n[here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli)\n\n###### Warning:\n\nKeep in mind that your Azure subscription type can limit the availability of your VMs, so make sure to tailor your subscription to the availability requirements of your infrastructure.\n\n## Permissions\n\n[](/reference/configuring-cloud-provider#permissions)\n\nSince Plural is responsible for creating over 50 different applications, what permissions are required will vary based on what you're deploying. In most cases, Admin access is the simplest to use. For example, when provisioning Airbyte, we'll need to create an IAM role and IRSA binding to the EKS control plane, which is an Admin only action.\n\n#### Service Account Permissions\n\n[](/reference/configuring-cloud-provider#service-account-permissions)\n\nWhen deploying via GCP, you may run into a Terraform error around permissions. Plural will need to create a various set of resources in order to make sure that your Kubernetes cluster is configured correctly. We recommend attaching the following permission roles to the service account associated with your CLI or Cloud Shell:\n\nownerstorage.admin\n\nFollow these steps to authorize your GCloud CLI with a new or existing Service Account.\n\n[these steps](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing#authorize_with_a_service_account)\n\nNo special permissions necessary, but as mentioned above, providing Plural Administrator access will prevent issues around application specific requirements.\n\nNo special permissions necessary, but as mentioned above, providing Plural Administrator access will prevent issues around application specific requirements. Make sure you're specifically providing Administrator access for the resource group you're deploying Plural into.\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/reference/configuring-cloud-provider.md)",

        "text": "# Troubleshooting\n\nHere is a non-exhaustive list of common issues or errors during the install or operation of Plural. If you see an error not listed here or get stuck in general, just hop into our Discord for help.\n\n## Helm Errors\n\n[](/reference/troubleshooting#helm-errors)\n\nHelm can be tempermental at times, here are some errors that will ocassionally pop up\n\n### another operation (install/upgrade/rollback) is in progress\n\n[](/reference/troubleshooting#another-operation-install-upgrade-rollback-is-in-progress)\n\nhelm upgrade --install --skip-crds --namespace APP APP /path/to/chart 2023/03/23 02:02:15 another operation (install/upgrade/rollback) is in progress\n\nIn this case you need to roll back your helm release to the last successful version. You can do this by running:\n\nhelm history APP --namespace APP to find the latest safe version, then run: helm rollback APP VSN --namespace APP to get helm back in a safe state.\n\nYou should then be able to run either plural deploy  or plural bounce without issue.\n\n## Git Errors\n\n[](/reference/troubleshooting#git-errors)\n\n### Could not compare workspace to origin\n\n[](/reference/troubleshooting#could-not-compare-workspace-to-origin)\n\nFailed to get git information: Could not compare current workspace to origin, do you have an 'origin' remote configured, or does your repo not have an inital commit?\n\nThis error either means you cannot push information to Git, or you do not have a remote branch set up to track your local one. Make sure you've added your SSH keys to Github and verify that your origin is set by running git remote -v.\n\n### Out of date\n\n[](/reference/troubleshooting#out-of-date)\n\nYour local workspace is not in sync with remote, either 'git pull' recent changes or 'git push' any missed changes.\n\nThis error can happen if you're ahead of or behind your remote by a few commits, so try git push if git pull does not resolve the issue.\n\n## Cloud Errors\n\n[](/reference/troubleshooting#cloud-errors)\n\n### Google Credentials\n\n[](/reference/troubleshooting#google-credentials)\n\nYou don't have necessary services enabled. Please run: 'gcloud services enable serviceusage.googleapis.com cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com container.googleapis.com' with an owner of the project to enable or enable them in the GCP console.\n\nEnsure that you've run the gcloud command in the correct project, and make sure you have owner rights.\n\n### AWS Credentials\n\n[](/reference/troubleshooting#aws-credentials)\n\nFailed to get aws account (is your aws cli configured?)\n\nEnsure your AWS CLI is set up, that you have the correct profile chosen, and that you're authenticated in to AWS. If necessary, run export AWS_PROFILE=<profile-name> in the terminal you are running Plural in and auth in with aws sso login.\n\napi error AuthorizationHeaderMalformed: The authorization header is malformed; a non-empty Access Key (AKID) must be provided in the credential.\n\nMake sure you're authenticated in to AWS with aws sso login.\n\n### IAM policy update 403 permission denied\n\n[](/reference/troubleshooting#iam-policy-update-403-permission-denied)\n\nYou will see permission errors if your Cloud account does not have permissions to create the IAM roles needed by Plural. Apply the correct permissions to the user account that Plural is deploying as.\n\n### Requested project not found\n\n[](/reference/troubleshooting#requested-project-not-found)\n\nError 404: The requested project was not found., notFound\n\nIf you are running plural build and encounter a project requested not found error it's possible that your application default credential is set to the wrong gcp project. Run:\n\n```\ngcloud auth application-default login\n```\n\nto reset the credential and reauthorize the browser for the correct project.\n\n###### Info:\n\nIf you're experiencing persistent issues with a Cloud Provider CLI, try updating the CLI and/or SDK.\n\n## Initialization Errors\n\n[](/reference/troubleshooting#initialization-errors)\n\n### Workspace Initialization\n\n[](/reference/troubleshooting#workspace-initialization)\n\nYour workspace hasn't been configured, try running 'plural init' Could not find workspace.yaml file, you might need to run 'plural init'\n\nBase cloud provider setup for a Plural repository is stored in your workspace.yaml file. This should be created when running plural init.\n\n### Kubconfig missing\n\n[](/reference/troubleshooting#kubconfig-missing)\n\n2022/12/19 16:56:24 stat /home/plural/.kube/config: no such file or directory\n\nThis will happen because for whatever reason your kubeconfig is not available locally. This will occasionally happen if your cloud shell pod was recently recreated, if you're using a new laptop, or if the file was deleted/expired accidentally. To fix, run:\n\n```\nplural wkspace kube-init\n```\n\nin your repo and we'll generate a new one for you.\n\n## Deployment Errors\n\n[](/reference/troubleshooting#deployment-errors)\n\n### Invalid apiVersion for K8s\n\n[](/reference/troubleshooting#invalid-apiversion-for-k8s)\n\nerror: exec plugin: invalid apiVersion \"client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1\" error: exec plugin: invalid apiVersion \"client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1\" exit status 1\n\nYou might see this when attempting to sync crds or run helm commands in a run of plural deploy. It's due to legacy versions of the aws cli generating deprecated kubeconfigs, if you upgrade your cli and rerun plural deploy it should be able to proceed successfully.\n\n### Failed deploy model\n\n[](/reference/troubleshooting#failed-deploy-model)\n\nFailed deploy model due to Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook \"mtargetgroupbinding.elbv2.k8s.aws\": Post \"https://aws-load-balancer-webhook-service.bootstrap.svc:443/mutate-elbv2-k8s-aws-v1beta1-targetgroupbinding?timeout=10s\"\n\nThe aws load balancer controller webhook is not fully reliable; if you see this error it's just a matter of recreating the webhook which you can do with:\n\n```\nkubectl delete validatingwebhookconfiguration aws-load-balancer-webhook -n bootstrap\nplural bounce bootstrap\n```\n\n### Error acquiring state lock\n\n[](/reference/troubleshooting#error-acquiring-state-lock)\n\nTerraform acquires a state lock to protect the state from being written by multiple users at the same time. Please resolve the issue above and try again.\n\nIf your deploy is interrupted, it's possible terraform state gets confused. To fix this, you'll need to:\n\n```\ncd <app-name>/terraform\nterraform force-unlock <lock-id>\n```\n\nYou should be able to find the state lock id from the error message. Terraform stacks for each app are located in a standard terraform folder each time.\n\n### May not specify more than one provider type\n\n[](/reference/troubleshooting#may-not-specify-more-than-one-provider-type)\n\nIf you are running plural deploy and encounter the error below there may be stale state from the previous install.\n\n```\nError: UPGRADE FAILED: cannot patch \"letsencrypt-prod\" with kind ClusterIssuer: admission webhook \"webhook.cert-manager.io\" denied the request: spec.acme.solvers[0].dns01.route53: Forbidden: may not specify more than one provider type\n```\n\nRun:\n\n```\nhelm del bootstrap -n bootstrap\nplural deploy\n```\n\n### Error reading route table association\n\n[](/reference/troubleshooting#error-reading-route-table-association)\n\nerror reading Route Table Association () : Empty result\n\nThis is a possible terraform race condition where the route tables think they're being read before they've been created, but in fact, they have already been created. As a temporary fix, just wait some time and rerun the deploy:\n\n```\nplural deploy\n```\n\n### Cloud resource limits exceeded\n\n[](/reference/troubleshooting#cloud-resource-limits-exceeded)\n\nIt's possible plural will deploy resources that exceed your cloud limits. In general the most pessimistic of these are load balancer limits and VPC limits. Be sure you have headroom in both those dimensions. This can lead to terraform state corruption, in which case you'll need to do something along the lines of for all resources missing from your terraform state:\n\n```\ncd application-name/terraform\nterraform import path_to_terraform_resource resource_id\n```\n\nIf you devise a better way to recover crashed terraform state, please give us a shout in our Discord. We'd love to automate this better.\n\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/pluralsh)\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/reference/troubleshooting.md)",

This is to sync your installations and allow for the delivery of automated upgrades. You will not be asked to provide any infrastructure credentials or sensitive information.\n\n[https://app.plural.sh](https://app.plural.sh)\n\nNext, install the Plural CLI. If you're on Mac, the brew tap is the easiest way to do this, as it installs Helm, Terraform, and kubectl for you. For alternate installation methods such as curl and Docker, click here.\n\n[click here](https://docs.plural.sh/getting-started/quickstart#install-plural-cli)\n\n```\nbrew install pluralsh/plural/plural\n```\n\n###### Warning:\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure that your cloud provider CLI is properly configured and updated to the latest version. If it is not configured correctly, Plural will fail and won't be able to create resources on your behalf.\n\nPlural uses a GitOps workflow to manage configuration files and deployment state, so you'll need a Git repository to store your Plural configuration. Plural supports GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket currently. If you're planning on using Bitbucket, follow this guide. This repository will contain the Helm charts, Terraform config, and Kubernetes manifests that Plural will autogenerate for you.\n\n[this guide](https://docs.plural.sh/getting-started/manage-git-repositories/setting-up-gitops#manual-git-setup)\n\nNavigate to a directory that you would like to create this Git repository in and run plural init. This will start a configuration wizard to configure your Git repo and cloud provider for use with Plural.\n\n## Installing Dagster\n\n[](/applications/dagster#installing-dagster)\n\nRun this command to find the bundle name associated with your cloud provider:\n\n```\nplural bundle list dagster\n```\n\nNow, to add it to your workspace, run the install command with the bundle name that you received in the previous step. This will guide you through some minor configuration of your Dagster installation, such as choosing the subdomain that your Dagster installation will be hosted at. If you are on AWS, it would look like this:\n\n```\nplural bundle install dagster dagster-aws\n```\n\nTo generate the Helm charts, Terraform, and deployment YAML, run:\n\n```\nplural build\n```\n\nTo deploy your infrastructure and commit the changes to your origin Git repository, run:\n\n```\nplural deploy --commit \"deploying dagster\"\n```\n\n## Installing the Plural Console\n\n[](/applications/dagster#installing-the-plural-console)\n\nPlural comes with a console that provides DevOps workflows, customized dashboards, and an interactive UI for managing your Kubernetes cluster. It's not required, but highly recommended. You can install the console the same way that you installed Dagster:\n\n```\nplural bundle install console console-aws\nplural build\nplural deploy --commit \"deploying the console too\"\n```\n\n## Accessing your Dagster installation\n\n[](/applications/dagster#accessing-your-dagster-installation)\n\nNavigate to dagster.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.onplural.sh to access the Dagster UI. If you set up a different subdomain for Dagster during the plural bundle install phase, use that instead.\n\n## Uninstalling Dagster\n\n[](/applications/dagster#uninstalling-dagster)\n\nTo bring down your Plural installation of Dagster, run:\n\n```\nplural destroy dagster\n```\n\nTo bring down your entire Plural deployment, run:\n\n```\nplural destroy\n```\n\n###### Warning:\n\nOnly do this if you're absolutely sure you want to bring down all associated resources with this repository.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n[](/applications/dagster#troubleshooting)\n\nIf you run into any issues with installing Dagster on Plural, feel free to join our Discord Community so that we can help you out.\n\n[Discord Community](https://discord.gg/pluralsh)\n\nIf you'd like to request any updates or new features for our Dagster installation, feel free to open an issue here.\n\n[here](https://github.com/pluralsh/plural-artifacts)\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/applications/dagster.mdpart)",

This is because it is a dependency for the Plural Console, which requires a Postgres database to store state about your Plural installation.\n\nSome applications may also have a Postgres database as a dependency, in which case a separate database would be deployed for that application. These databases can be accessed directly using the plural proxy CLI command which you can learn about here.\n\n[here](/operations/managing-applications/connect-application-db)\n\nTo fulfill these requests for a database, Plural uses the Zalando Postgres Operator. This allows us to create Postgres databases on-demand when required by an application.\n\n[Zalando Postgres Operator](https://github.com/zalando/postgres-operator)\n\n## Using the Postgres Operator\n\n[](/applications/postgres#using-the-postgres-operator)\n\nWhile we use the operator automatically to create databases for applications, you can invoke the operator yourself to manually spin up a database for your own use cases.\n\nTo do this, place the following YAML into any application directory (we recommend /postgres/helm/postgres/templates):\n\n```\napiVersion: acid.zalan.do/v1\nkind: postgresql\nmetadata:\n  annotations:\n    meta.helm.sh/release-name: plural\n    meta.helm.sh/release-namespace: plural\n  labels:\n    app: postgres\n    app.kubernetes.io/instance: plural\n    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Helm\n    app.kubernetes.io/name: plural\n    app.kubernetes.io/version: 0.9.16-rc5\n    db: plural\n    helm.sh/chart: plural-0.9.37\n  name: plural-plural\n  namespace: plural\nspec:\n  clone:\n    cluster: plural-clone\n  databases:\n    plural: plural\n  numberOfInstances: 2\n  postgresql:\n    parameters:\n      max_connections: \"101\"\n    version: \"13\"\n  resources:\n    limits:\n      cpu: \"2\"\n      memory: 1Gi\n    requests:\n      cpu: 400m\n      memory: 1Gi\n  sidecars:\n  - env:\n    - name: DATA_SOURCE_URI\n      value: 127.0.0.1:5432/plural?sslmode=disable\n    - name: DATA_SOURCE_USER\n      valueFrom:\n        secretKeyRef:\n          key: username\n          name: postgres.plural-plural.credentials.postgresql.acid.zalan.do\n    - name: DATA_SOURCE_PASS\n      valueFrom:\n        secretKeyRef:\n          key: password\n          name: postgres.plural-plural.credentials.postgresql.acid.zalan.do\n    image: gcr.io/pluralsh/postgres-exporter:0.8.0\n    livenessProbe:\n      failureThreshold: 6\n      httpGet:\n        path: /\n        port: http-metrics\n        scheme: HTTP\n      initialDelaySeconds: 5\n      periodSeconds: 10\n      successThreshold: 1\n      timeoutSeconds: 5\n    name: exporter\n    ports:\n    - containerPort: 9187\n      name: http-metrics\n      protocol: TCP\n    readinessProbe:\n      failureThreshold: 6\n      httpGet:\n        path: /\n        port: http-metrics\n        scheme: HTTP\n      initialDelaySeconds: 5\n      periodSeconds: 10\n      successThreshold: 1\n      timeoutSeconds: 5\n  teamId: plural\n  tolerations:\n  - effect: NoSchedule\n    key: plural.sh/pluralReserved\n    operator: Exists\n  users:\n    plural:\n    - superuser\n    - createdb\n  volume:\n    size: 75Gi\n```\n\nNow run plural deploy --commit \"deploy postgres\" and the Postgres Operator will pick up your request and create the database for you.\n\n## Accessing the Database manually\n\n[](/applications/postgres#accessing-the-database-manually)\n\nIn order to access your database directly, you'll need to get the generated password. This is located in a Kubernetes secret within the Postgres namespace.\n\nTo find the password secret, make sure that you have kubectl configured to point at the relevant cluster and run the following command:\n\n```\nkubectl get secrets -n postgres\n```\n\nThe relevant secret should follow the naming convention dbuser.dbname.acid.zalando. To decrypt the secret, run the following command:\n\n```\nkubectl get secrets/{SECRET_NAME} --template={{.data.password}} | base64 -d\n```\n\nNow with the username in the name of this secret and the decrypted password, you can now access your database.\n\n## Using the Database with other Plural Applications\n\n[](/applications/postgres#using-the-database-with-other-plural-applications)\n\nA common use case for spinning up a new Postgres database is using it with another Plural application, for example, Superset. To connect any application to the Postgres database on the same Kubernetes cluster, use the following address:\n\n{POSTGRES_POD_NAME}.postgres:5432\n\nTo get the Pod name for your Postgres database, run kubectl get pods -n postgres in the relevant Kubernetes cluster.\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/applications/postgres.mdpart)",

A simple solution is to create a basic auth user in Plural.\n\nprefect: users: { <username>: <password> }\n\nPlural has a utility to create a password. `plural crypto random will create a random string that can be used as a password.\n\n### Step 2: Install Prefect CLI\n\n[](/applications/prefect#step-2-install-prefect-cli)\n\nTo install the Prefect CLI locally, you will need to have Python and pip installed on your machine.\n\nOpen a terminal window and run the following command to install the Prefect CLI:\n\n```\npip install prefect\n```\n\nOnce the installation is complete, you can verify that the CLI is installed by running the following command:\n\n```\nprefect --version\n``\n\n### Step 3: Create a profile to connect to Plural\n\nPrefect allows you to have multiple profiles to connect to different Orion instances. I.e local, cloud or self-hosted. Plural is a self-hosted solution.\n\n1) Create a new profile prefect profile create <profile-name> set the profile name to plural\n2) On the new profile, set the PREFECT_API_URL with prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL=\"https://<user>:<password>@<yourprefecturl>.onplural.sh/api\"\n3) <user> and <password> are from the Plural config above. <yourprefecturl> is the URL you use to connect to Prefect Orion ending with .onplural.sh/api\n\n### Step 4: Test running a local file on the Plural Prefect instances\n\n1) Create a file called test_flow.py\n2) Add the following:\n\n```python\nfrom prefect import flow\n\n@flow\ndef test_flow():\n    print(\"What is your favorite number?\")\n    print(42)\n\nif name == \"__main__\":\n    test_flow()\n\n\n3) Run the file locally python test_flow.py\n```\n\nIf everything is functioning, you should see a flow run on the Plural hosted Prefect Orion UI.\n\nGuide contributed by @reeves from the Plural Discord.\n\n[Edit on Github](https://github.com/pluralsh/documentation/blob/main/pages/applications/prefect.mdpart)",
